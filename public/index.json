Since then quite a bit has changed. In this article we will overall all the services and applications I am running on my home server, discuss alternatives, and the overall structure of my ecosystem.\nWarning! This article is activily being worked on. Also, I highly recommend AirVPN in combination with Gluetun. Checkout my video on this set up. My Setup # Last time around I had a variety of systems keeping everything going this included two NAS systems running Proxmox and Unraid, and then a Intel NUC running Ubuntu Server. Since then we have ditched Unraid in favor using two separates NAS systems together in a Proxmox Node.\nHardware # This is all the hardware I\u0026rsquo;m currently using with affilate links. I will note, I\u0026rsquo;m using these NAS systems as I got them for free as review units. I plan on building my own rack mount system when funds allow.\nZimacube NAS: Affilate Link | Video Everything else: Amazon Store The first node is running on a ZimaCube is this responsible for all my media servers and management. Additionally it has a windows virtual machine that I can spin up when needed. The second node is virtually everything else running on a single LXC with docker or running independently from a community installation script. I hope in the future to build my own server as to rid my use of desktop NAS systems, granted they have been great thus far.\nIn my network I also have two Raspberry Pis. One of them is a Pi 5 with a PoE HAT and that is responsible for a Twingate connector and updating my IP address on Cloudflare. The other is hooked up to a 3D printer running Octoprint.\nDashboards # Dashboard are used to create a simple webpage with links to all the services, websites, or really anything you care about. What makes each dashboard special and unique is the features they come with. Many can act as monitoring tools, have widgets to get more details from services, weather, and more.\nGlance # This dashboard is a new addition for me, it’s not the most feature rich of the options out there, but for me it’s simplistic and default look and feel is what stands out to me. You can use it to monitor and link to all your applications, like most tools in this category, but it also is great for monitoring various feeds, websites, and a customizable RSS feed. I use the tool as a start page for my web browser and it gives a quick and simple glance of everything that I care about. One of the best things about it, in my opinion, is that everything is customized and configured in a simple yaml file.\nResources: Video | Github\nHomarr # I’m not using this one at the moment, but it’s currently a VERY CLOSE second for me. This one is more feature rich than Glance as it has much more widgets and is customizable though the graphical interface of the application. Homarr has it’s main focus in the name and that is a deep integration with the *arr stack of applications. This dashboard, like Glance, can be used to monitor the up status of your applications, but it also integrates easily with Docker, Proxmox and other platforms.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nTools and Utilities # File Browser # This is another new addition, while not great for moving or copying large amounts of data, it has helped me significantly jumping though my rather large media server. Features rather simple and straight forward file management features, as described on their official website; “File Browser is a create-your-own-cloud-kind of software where you can install it on a server, direct it to a path and then access your files through a nice web interface. You have many available features!”\nResources: Github | Website\nVaultwarden # After being suggested this for YEARS I finally bit the bullet and have a self-hosted password vault. It’s fully compatible with Bitwardens extensions and applications, this allows be to keep all my passwords, emails, and payment information in one place.\nResources: Github\nHoarder # My video covering Hoarder may have turned into a unfortunate story of drama, that’s not to take away from how awesome this tool actually is. I think of it as a dumping ground for anything I come across that is slightly interesting. This is a self-hostable bookmark-everything app with a touch of AI for the data hoarders out there. Some of the features include the ability to take simple notes and store images and pdfs, automatic fetching for link titles, descriptions and images, sorting tools, and full text search of all the content stored.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nPortainer # I’ll admit, I do have plans to slowly remove Portainer from my home server. I’ve gotten conformable enough with using docker compose and other Docker features in the command line that is almost slows me down. With that said Portainer is a GREAT tool for managing Docker stacks, containers, and other instances on other machines.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nCockpit # Cockpit is one of the best tools that you can use to give your server a nice web interface to monitor and manage. Their website says; “See your server in a web browser and perform system tasks with a mouse. It’s easy to start containers, administer storage, configure networks, and inspect logs. Basically, you can think of Cockpit like a graphical “desktop interface”, but for individual servers.”\nI was using this in a centralized LXC for managing shares and using various extensions to give cockpit even more features. After a very resent change in my home server setup I yet to install it on anything, but I’m leaving it here on this list as it is an amazing tool.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nOctoprint # Octoprint is another great tool that has actually helped me increase the use of my 3D printer. I have this software setup on a Raspberry Pi 4 plugged directly into the printer. Essentially turning my dumb 3D printer smart. This allow control of all aspects of 3D printing including, uploading gcodes, printing, monitoring, and much more. Setting up camera monitoring and video recording is a simple as plugging in a webcam.\nResources: Github | Website\nMedia Server # Jellyfin # Jellyfin is by far the best free and open source media server on the market right now. It has all the features you’d expect without any paywalls. This includes streaming to a wide variety of platforms. I currently run Jellyfin as a backup to Plex as that is currently my preferred platform. See the video about for much more information.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nPlex # Plex is my main media streaming platform. I have quite a few family members using it and Plex has support for more platforms and easier login capabilities. I’ve also recent setup a TV tuner and it has been working great. Another reason why I use Plex is the support for 3rd party tools such as Tautulli that we will get into below.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nTautulli # While Plex does have some statistics and logs to see what’s going on, it is nothing compared to what we get from Tautulli. From their website; “Tautulli is a 3rd party application that you can run alongside your Plex Media Server to monitor activity and track various statistics. Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched, who watched it, when and where they watched it, and how it was watched.” This data is very helpful when I clean up and remove some media from the server. One of my favorite features of all this is the newsletter option that you can setup giving the users a overview of new media that has been added to the server.\nResources: Github | Website\nMedia Management # Many of the applications below act in similar function with a slightly different goal or media type so the descriptions will be brief. With that these tools are by far some of my favorites in my home server.\nOverseerr # Overseerr is an amazing tool for discovering new movies and shows as well as having Plex users request media they want to see. Overseerr integrates really well into Plex and some of the other services in this category. It can see what is already in your media library and if a request is made it can automatically add that entry to Radarr or Sonarr. I particularity like it because of the discover functionality, you can filter movies and shows by what streaming service they’re on, rating, and more.\nResources: Github | Website\nRadarr # Radarr is a media organization tool for movies. This allows you see scan your library to see everything you have. Manage file file names, see the media quality, and even search indexers for media. From their wiki; “Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.”\nResources: Wiki | Github | Website\nSonarr # This does all the same things as Radarr but with TV shows and series. It uses TVDB to see if you’re missing any episodes and even specials. From their wiki; “Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.”\nResources: Wiki | Github | Website\nLidarr # This acts the same as Radarr and Sonarr, but for music. From their wiki; “Lidarr is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.”\nResources: Wiki | Github | Website\nBazarr # This also acts similar to the other *arr application, but with a focus on subtitles. From the Bazarr site; “Bazarr is a companion application to Sonarr and Radarr that manages and downloads subtitles based on your requirements. [With manual search to] find all the matching subtitles, choose the one you want and download it to your media directory with the proper name to be used by your media player.”\nResources: Wiki | Github | Website\nProwlarr # Without using Prowlarr you’d need to manually setup your trackers and indexers in each application. This allows a centralized place to manage that aspect of these tools if you’re using it in this way. From their wiki; “Prowlarr is an indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. It integrates seamlessly with LazyLibrarian, Lidarr, Mylar3, Radarr, Readarr, and Sonarr offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required (we do it all).”\nResources: Wiki | Github | Website\nDownload Clients # I highly recommened using a VPN for downloading things. Esspecially when using peer-to-peer downloaders. Using a VPN will keep your public IP address hidden. I have tired a few VPN services and so far my favorite is AirVPN, they\u0026rsquo;re not a sponsor, but that is a affilate link.\nqBittorrent # This is a web version of the popular qBittorrent peer-to-peer file sharing client. Overall its clean, simple, and has a fair bit of features. Works well with AirVPN (my favorite VPN service) and integrates well with various *arr applications.\nResources: Github | Website\nNZBGet # This is a Usenet client written is C++. It works very well and out of any that I’ve used it seems to give the least amount of issues. This can pull files, fix them in some cases is the health is low, rename and move files.\nhttps://nzbget.net/ Resources: Github | Website\nFiles and Images # Nextcloud # Nextcloud is the best in the game for replacing cloud services like Google Drive, Onedrive, and so on. Not only can it act as a great on-premise cloud, but there are many other add-ons and features that it offers. This includes a complete groupware suite, collaborative document editing, tasks, and much more.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nImmich # This is arguably the most important application that I am running. This is what I’ve used to completely replace Google Photos. Myself and a few of my family members use this as their primary Photo back solution. It has a mobile app that supports easy backups and some other key features include facial recognition and a location map of your photos. From their website; “Easily back up, organize, and manage your photos on your own server. Immich helps you browse, search and organize your photos and videos with ease, without sacrificing your privacy.”\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nDocmost # This is a new addition and it’s actually how I’m initially drafting this entire article. In my hunt to replace Notion I’ve started using this. While I’m still on a hunt for a more one-to-one replacement this is doing the trick for now. This tool is used to manage your own personal wiki, knowledge base, and notes. The UI is clean, elegant, and simple.\nResources: Github | Website\nSmart Home and Automation # Home Assistant # Home Assistant is a great tool that allows the connection of many devices in your smart home and integrate them together with a variety blueprints, automatons, and more. You can create custom dashboards, use their mobile app, and so much more I can’t even properly describe here how much this tool is capable of.\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/ Resources: Video | Github | Website\nFrigate # Frigate is the best open source, self-hosted NVR option that I can find. For a while I was using Blue Iris, but I HATE that you have to use Windows. This tool shines with you hook it up with a Coral TPU for AI object detection. The interface is wonderful and it supports most of what you’d expect of an NVR. Granted depending on your cameras it may be difficult to configure and use all the features a camera may support, for example, two way audio.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nZigbee2MQTT # I was originally using this with Home Assistant as an add-on, but I’ve noticed it to be way more reliable if it is separated out. Zigbee2MQTT supports various Zigbee adapters and a bunch of devices.\nResources: Github | Website\nDNS and Remote Connections # Pi-Hole # By far the most popular “DNS Sinkhole” a Domain Name Service that blocks certain DNS inquires. In the case of Pi-Hole it uses black lists full of domains associated with advertisements and tracking. For example, one of the most blocked domain on my server is s2s.mparticle.com a data collection firm. And with Pi-Hole I can investigate and figure out why this data collection company is being reached out to so much. This is in addition to the main use case of simple ad blocking. Pi-Hole has many other features I’ve yet to dive into, but it’s a wonderful tool that is worth tying out of anyone.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nNGINX Proxy Manager # NGINX Proxy Manager is a simple web based proxy manager for setting up and forwarding domain names to your services and generating SSL certifications. I use this for both local top level domains and exposing a few select services to the public internet.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nTwingate # Full disclosure, Twingate is one of the channel sponsors. This is a VPN alternative for remotely connecting to your home server. It works by spinning up a smaller connector on your local network, then you use a client to establish a secure peer-to-peer connection. All this is managed and verified through the Twingate cloud platform. Something I started using recently is the Twingate service API to connect with a headless client. Connecting to one headless service to another.\nhttps://bit.ly/twingate1024 Resources: Video | Website\nCloudflare DDNS # This is a very simple docker container used to update your public IP address within the Cloudflare A records using their API. I need to use this becuase my public IP is dynamic, meaning it will randomly and automatically change every few weeks or sometimes every few days. From their Github it’s; “A feature-rich and robust Cloudflare DDNS updater with a small footprint. The program will detect your machine’s public IP addresses and update DNS records using the Cloudflare API.”\nResources: Video | Github\nData and Metrics # Grafana # Grafana is a BEAUTIFUL dashboard tool that can translate various databases into stunning graphs, charts, and presentation. There is a huge amount of integrations and custom dashboard that many people create for their specific use cases. You can easily add a connection and import a dashboard to display the data. The most popular is for the Node Exporter that you can see above.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nTeslaMate # TeslaMate is a tool that uses the Tesla API to gather every possible data point about the car. This includes trips, mileage, battery, elevation, and much more. This is a stack that includes Teslamate itself, a database, Grafana, and a few others.\nResources: Github | Website\nInfluxDB2 # InfluxDB is described as; “Purpose-built database for all types of time series data at any scale.” This database tool has it’s own way to turn data into charts and graphs, but I’m primarily using it for helpful data from my Proxmox server and pulling that data to Grafana dashboards.\nhttps://www.influxdata.com/ Resources: Video | Github | Website\nPrometheus (with Node Exporter) # Like InfluxDB this is a data collection tool for monitoring and data analytics. This one this the most popular of what I’m using so there are a ton of different integrations and dashboards to pick from. The most popular and probably the easiest to setup is the Node Exporter, I have this installed and two Raspberry Pi systems for monitoring.\nResources: Video | Github | Website\nWarning!

I\u0026rsquo;ll also talk about a couple of new features in the Desktop Environment world, and a really weird AI phone.\nMozilla Firefox 136 released with Vertical Tabs and ARM64 # Going back from last week\u0026rsquo;s controversies to software development, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to share that Firefox 136 has been released. This update includes official Linux binary packages for the ARM64 architecture, but also hardware video decoding for AMD GPUs.\nThe new Vertical layout, by 9to5Linux.\nThe biggest feature, though, is vertical tabs; when enabling that layout, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to access bookmarks and tabs from other devices, too:\nSidebar settings for the vertical layout.\nOther tools include history and a handy AI chatbot, if you\u0026rsquo;re into that. Interestingly, the settings now allow you to opt in or out of \u0026ldquo;studies\u0026rdquo;, where Mozilla will roll out experimental features to a subset of people to see if they work well or not.\n**Checkout the full article: source **\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re talking about Mozilla already, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that they also released an updated statement about last week\u0026rsquo;s Terms of Use controversy. The new wording of the ToU is the following:\nIt also includes a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for the purpose of doing as you request with the content you input in Firefox. This does not give Mozilla any ownership in that content.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be the judge of whether this is something you\u0026rsquo;d deem more acceptable. They also gave some further context into why they deleted the \u0026ldquo;we won\u0026rsquo;t sell your data\u0026rdquo; promise:\nIn order to make Firefox commercially viable, there are a number of places where we collect and share some data with our partners, including our optional ads on New Tab and providing sponsored suggestions in the search bar. We set all of this out in our Privacy Notice. Whenever we share data with our partners, we put a lot of work into making sure that the data that we share is stripped of potentially identifying information, or shared only in the aggregate, or is put through our privacy preserving technologies (like OHTTP). And:\nThe reason we’ve stepped away from making blanket claims that “We never sell your data” is because, in some places, the LEGAL definition of “sale of data” is broad and evolving. As an example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) defines “sale” as the “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by [a] business to another business or a third party” in exchange for “monetary” or “other valuable consideration.” That is, the sending of interaction data with ads in the new tab page / search bar is technically considered \u0026ldquo;selling user data\u0026rdquo; in those jurisdictions. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that the Privacy Notice points out exactly what kind of (aggregated) data is sent to advertisers, and it\u0026rsquo;s only a subset of all collected data (e.g. only interaction data, clicks, time spent on ads, and so on).\nCheckout the full announcement here: source\nThunderbird 136 released with new Appearance controls # Thunderbird announced a move to monthly releases by default, and they seem to be synced with Firefox releases too!

Then, our menu offers: a quick update on the Rust on Linux drama, a new release of Fish Shell, a few GNOME and Plasma improvements, and the worst surveillance law in the EU! Hungry yet?\nMozilla introduces new controversial Terms of Use # Thursday morning I woke up and took a quick look at the trending threads on r/linux (I do that sometimes, to see what people are interested in). One of the most popular posts read: \u0026ldquo;Introducing terms of use and updated privacy notice for Firefox\u0026rdquo;.\nCould that be something worth talking about? I scanned the comments. Some were worried, but the consensus was that this was nothing newsworthy. Reassured, I discarded it and eventually settled for another video topic.\nCheckout this video from Nicco Loves Linux!\nWell, I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have. Less than 24 hours later, this legal change is everywhere: people are claiming that the new terms of use give Mozilla all of your data, that they disallow pornography, that AI is going to be trained with it, and more.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s clarify some things, shall we?\nThe first controversial change was the following:\nYou give Mozilla all rights necessary to operate Firefox, including processing data as we describe in the Firefox Privacy Notice, as well as acting on your behalf to help you navigate the internet. When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.\nWhich has since then been rephrased to:\nYou give Mozilla the rights necessary to operate Firefox. This includes processing your data as we describe in the Firefox Privacy Notice. It also includes a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for the purpose of doing as you request with the content you input in Firefox. This does not give Mozilla any ownership of that content.\nBoth Chrome and Edge (and many other non-browser apps) have similar statements in their terms of use. According to Firefox, this clause is required for the browser to interact in any way with the data you\u0026rsquo;re sharing. Note also that this does not give them the right to do whatever they want with the data you license them: they also have to abide by the Privacy Notice, which is somehow strict and well documented.\nIn particular, the following types of data are shared with commercial partners (all in an aggregated way): what OS and browser version you\u0026rsquo;re using, what country/city you are in, your language, browser settings, system performance, how many tabs you have open, how many searches you\u0026rsquo;ve performed, and excerpts from those searches.\nThis is because the new tab page might have advertisements (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this is opt-in).\nThe issue is: even though this data is only shared in an aggregated way since Mozilla earns from those ads, this could technically be classified as \u0026ldquo;selling your data\u0026rdquo; under some jurisdictions (such as California\u0026rsquo;s). To protect themselves from false advertising lawsuits, Mozilla thus decided to entirely drop their \u0026ldquo;We do not sell your data\u0026rdquo; statement from their FAQ page, replacing it with \u0026ldquo;We do not sell your data in the sense that\u0026rsquo;s commonly attributed to it\u0026rdquo;.\nAs they put it:\nIn order to make Firefox commercially viable, there are a number of places where we collect and share some data with our partners, including our optional ads on New Tab and providing sponsored suggestions in the search bar. We set all of this out in our Privacy Notice. Whenever we share data with our partners, we put a lot of work into making sure that the data that we share is stripped of potentially identifying information, shared only in the aggregate, or is put through our privacy-preserving technologies (like OHTTP).\nOf course, the fact that Mozilla was backing out from \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t sell your data\u0026rdquo; was widely shared on the web, lacking the context behind the decision or the new phrasing of it. Still, this does not inspire confidence in Firefox either.\nRegarding pornography, the new Terms also linked to an \u0026ldquo;Acceptable Use Policy\u0026rdquo;. This did not apply to Firefox, but rather to Mozilla services (such as their VPN). This policy disallowed anything illegal and violent content and pornography. Again, other VPN providers have similar wording in their Terms of Use.\nMozilla has since then updated the page to make it more clear that the Acceptable Use Policy does not apply to Firefox.\nOverall, I believe that Mozilla might have some more legal footing compared to what most people believe, but they certainly did not communicate these changes correctly, and they are fully responsible for the public pushback they obtained.\nCheckout the full blogpost: source\nChristoph Hellwig steps down from DMA-mapping maintainer # As a quick update to last week\u0026rsquo;s Rust for Linux drama, Hellwig (the maintainer who was highly critical of introducing Rust in the DMA, and who drove Hector Martin to resign from the Asahi project) also decided to step down as a maintainer following Linus Torvalds\u0026rsquo; reply to him.

Additionally, minor updates from KDE and GNOME reflect ongoing efforts to enhance their platforms. Lastly, a fun fact about a minor planet named Linux adds an quirky touch to tech lore.\nLinus Torvalds defends Rust for Linux # Firstly, I believe you deserve an update on last week\u0026rsquo;s story about Hector Martin. After he resigned from the Asahi Linux project to preserve his mental health, a new Linux kernel mailing list thread emerged about the R4L project, by Miguel Ojeda.\nThe new Linux kernel mailing list thread\nHe has published a page about the policies around using Rust in the Linux kernel. This covers many frequently asked questions, such as \u0026ldquo;Is there support from Linux maintainers for the R4L project?\u0026rdquo; (yes), \u0026ldquo;Will Rust be extra work for Linux maintainers?\u0026rdquo; (also yes), \u0026ldquo;Is R4L driven forward by the Rust community?\u0026rdquo; (no).\nThe beginning of the Rust kernel policy\nAs it was quickly pointed out by developer Hellwig, who is vocally against R4L, this policy webpage resides on the rust-for-linux.com website and has not been agreed upon by any non-R4L maintainer.\nHe also claimed that the policy contains incorrect information, such as the fact that \u0026ldquo;some subsystems may decide they do not want to have Rust code for the time being, typically for bandwidth reasons. This is fine and expected\u0026rdquo;. He then claimed that Linus has privately said that he would merge Rust code even if the maintainer objects, rendering the sentence untrue.\nSome of Hellwig\u0026rsquo;s criticism of the Rust kernel policy\nEventually, Linus Torvalds stepped in. Firstly, he explained that the patch Hellwig blocked (prompting Martin\u0026rsquo;s resignation) was not introducing any Rust code that Hellwig would\u0026rsquo;ve had to maintain, but it was simply adding the option to use Rust elsewhere:\nYou are saying that you disagree with Rust - which is fine, nobody has ever required you to write or read Rust code. But then you take that stance to mean that the Rust code cannot even use or interface to code you maintain. So let me be very clear: if you as a maintainer feel that you control who or what can use your code, YOU ARE WRONG.\nHe went on to say that if you refuse to learn or use Rust in the Linux codebase, that\u0026rsquo;s your right; but it does also mean that you won\u0026rsquo;t get to have a say on how the Rust interface is implemented by those who do contribute to the R4L project:\nYou are not forced to take any Rust code, or care about any Rust code in the DMA code. You can ignore it. But \u0026ldquo;ignore the Rust side\u0026rdquo; automatically also means that you don\u0026rsquo;t have any say on the Rust side.\nThis hopefully concludes the very heated week of R4L/Linux drama. Torvalds has always been publicly supportive of the R4L project, and he even complained that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t moving fast enough, so this reply should not come as a surprise to anyone.\nCOSMIC Alpha 6 Released # System76 has published the 6th alpha of the work-in-progress COSMIC desktop environment. This not only brings more stability to the system, but a few new features too, starting with the ability to zoom in on the desktop:\nThe Magnifier option in use\nIt can be activated in Settings, under the Accessibility section. It allows you to zoom through the Accessibility applet in the tray, or using the shortucts Super + =, Super + -, or Super + Mouse Scroll.\nStill in the a8y section, the applet now also has toggles for screen reading and a direct to its Settings page.\nThe Accessibility system applet\nYou can now have icons on your desktop. A settings page allows to show/hide mounted drives icons, the trash folder, and customize the size and spacing between icons.\nThe Desktop View settings page\nThe Alpha 6 also introduces new fractional scaling options, but it does so in what seems to me like a rather awkward way. Instead of displaying a scaling slider you get two different options:\nThe Scaling settings page\nThe \u0026ldquo;Scale\u0026rdquo; option allows you to select an integer-ish scaling (such as 125%). Then, you can fine-tune it through the \u0026ldquo;Additional scaling options\u0026rdquo;, which will simply be added to the previous \u0026ldquo;Scale\u0026rdquo; option. As an example, the resulting scaling in the screenshot is 210%.\nA few improvements were introduced for the Workspace view: you can now scroll through desktops and clicking on an empty space will exit the workspace view. The previews also now include the name of the desktops. Finally, if you the last two workspaces are empty, the last one will be removed automatically.\nThe new Workspace view\nCOSMIC also introduces window snapping, which they call \u0026ldquo;Floating windows gravitate to nearby edges\u0026rdquo;. It simply means that if you drag-and-drop a window near an edge, it will snap to it. You can also now see more than eight options in the launcher:\nI count 10!\nCheckout the full blogpost: source\nOBS threat to sue Fedora retracted # One thing I did not get to talk last week is OBS threat to sue Fedora. If you missed the story, here\u0026rsquo;s a quick recap: Fedora was packaging OBS to a Fedora Flatpak (an alternative to Flathub), but in doing so they broke many functionalities of OBS. Users did not know that, so they started complaining to OBS.\nEventually, OBS developers got fed up and asked to retract the badly packaged flatpak. After being ignored for a few weeks, they decided to threaten legal action had the package not been retracted or rebranded within seven business days.\nThe threat by Joel Bethke, OBS developer\nLuckily, Fedora managed to effectively damage control the situation. They immediately started discussions with OBS developers to solve the issues, marked the flatpak as End Of Life, and started a discussion on how to remove it.\nAfter some fruitious discussions between them, OBS felt like there was room for progress in their collaboration, and retracted their request (and associated threat).\nEffective damage control by the Fedora Project Leader and Flatpak SIG\nAs a result, the Fedora team is also now working on an explicit upstream-first statement to make sure that requests from packaged projects will be formally given higher priority from now on.\nProposal of The Upstream First Act\nNonetheless, the debate sparked much drama. The Fedora Project Leader, Matthew Miller, was interviewed by Brodie Robertson; during the interview, he said that Fedora Flatpaks are necessary since Flathub apps are barely reviewed and are more insecure or less standardized compared to what they offer. This is not entirely true, and the interview did not sit well with everyone. As an example, a blogpost was published on GNOME blogs by Jordan Petridis called \u0026ldquo;The Fedora Project Leader is willfully ignorant about Flathub\u0026rdquo;.\nCheckout the GitLab thread: source\nCassidy wants to get rid of the GNOME foot logo # Okay, that\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a sensationalized headline. However, Cassidy did publish a great article on the history of the logo, why it\u0026rsquo;s good/bad, and what should GNOME do with it:\nCassidy\u0026rsquo;s article\nAs an example, the complaints are that it does not convey anything about the project, it\u0026rsquo;s an awkward shape that does not fit well into a circle/square, and it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat unappealing (it\u0026rsquo;s a foot!).\nCassidy proposes to phase out the usage of the current logo, commission a designer to create a new one and immortalize the foot as a mascot, as a bit of an easter egg.\nCheckout the full article here: source\nA Few Goodies # We recently discovered that PewDiePie uses Linux Mint.

We will also dedicate a bit of time to talk about some exciting developments in the GNOME world.\nKDE Plasma 6.3 released # Last Tuesday, KDE has released version 6.3 of Plasma. It\u0026rsquo;s always special to talk about these releases here, as I\u0026rsquo;m a KDE developer and I sometimes get to praise my own work; I will however try to maintain by objectivity and start by saying that the slogan this time around is \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Pixel Perfect!\u0026rdquo;, and that this new version has few new major features, as it mostly focuses on maintenance and bug fixing.\nOne of the new goodies is panel cloning (and, as I hinted above, it was implemented by none other than myself!). The feature is simple: it allows you to copy all panel settings and applet to a new panel instance . The idea is to make it a bit easier to set up newly connected monitors, and it finally satisfies a feature request that was created five years ago.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can clone an image source\nIf I may indulge in a quick behind-the-scenes, panel cloning was implemented during an August 2024 vacation in the beautiful beaches of Dugi Otok. But I\u0026rsquo;m getting side-tracked: another major revamp is a complete redesign of the drawing tablets KCM (System Settings module). This only affects the few (lucky) owners and users of drawing tablets, but we should nonetheless all appreciate the gorgeous design that was the result of this work:\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. The design of the new drawing tablet KCM source\nFeature-wise, the new page allows you to map an area of the drawing tablet to the entire screen, customize pen sensitivity by directly manipulating its graph, re-map all stylus and tablet buttons, and more. Thirdly, as a further gift to designers and artists, 6.3 brings a pixel grid to the zoom effect:\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. The new zoom effect displays a pixel grid source\nThough this might not seem game-changing at first, I can assure you that it makes my job - Plasma development - easier, as often (fair enough, not that often!) I have to debug off-by-one pixel alignments that are almost invisible to the naked eye.\nThe design of desktop applets also improves, as they are now transparent and blur the desktop behind, Kickoff does not switch categories when hovering them anymore (though there\u0026rsquo;s an option to bring the old behavior back), and you can fully customize the icons used in its sidebar.\nCheckout the full announcement: source\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more to say, but if I allow myself to continue to talk about Plasma I might do so for the full newsletter (or more!).

I\u0026rsquo;ll try to give some context on the fly: the Asahi Linux project lead is Hector Martin, and has been since the beginningof the project. Due to various factors, he decided to resign; though he mentioned a lack of Apple M3/M4 support thus far, and missing Thunderbolt and USB-C video out, the arguments around Rust code in the Linux kernel also played a major role.\nIndeed, he has some strong words for the project and its leader:\nThe issues Rust for Linux has had surviving as an upstream Linux project are well documented, so I won’t repeat them in detail here. Suffice it to say, I consider Linus’ handling of the integration of Rust into Linux a major failure of leadership.\nand, later:\nWhen Apple released the M1, Linus Torvalds wished it could run Linux, but didn’t have much hope it would ever happen. We made it happen, and Linux 5.19 was released from an M2 MacBook Air running Asahi Linux. I had hoped his enthusiasm would translate to some support for our community and help with our upstreaming struggles. Sadly, that never came to pass. In November 2023 I sent him an invitation to discuss the challenges of kernel contributions and maintenance and see how we could help. He never replied.\nThis comes merely a week after Hector Martin tried to bring more attention to the situation via a Mastodon post, which was subsequently defined as \u0026ldquo;social media shaming\u0026rdquo;.

There are many services like Google Photos, Amazon Photos, Dropbox, iCloud, etc., designed to help us do this efficiently. However, these services come with some challenges. One is difficulty accessing data without an internet connection. Another concern is trusting these organizations to stay available and protect our data\u0026rsquo;s security. Additionally, some terms and conditions allow them to use or profit from the data we upload. For these reasons, I prefer hosting some of my most important data myself in my own home. After trying many different solution, I have landed on Immich as my go-to self hosted solution.\nImmich offers a refreshing alternative to services like Google Photos by prioritizing privacy and control. As a self-hosted solution, it keeps your photos and videos entirely on your own hardware, avoiding third-party data mining or subscription fees. You get full ownership of your media, support for RAW files, and customizable organization tools—like auto-sorting photos into folders based on dates, cameras, or custom rules. While setup requires some technical work and , it’s a trade-off for avoiding vendor lock-in and ads. Its local AI features (face/object recognition) may not match Google’s polish, but for users valuing transparency and flexibility, Immich is a compelling, ethical choice. Granted, there are some cons to using Immich. First, it requires more work and effort to manage the service, not having additional backups can be a huge risk to your data. Second, it isn’t as integrated with your smartphone as services like Google Photos or iCloud would be. Despite these drawbacks, I chose Immich because of its excellent mobile application for both Android and iPhone, which includes built-in photo backup support.\nPrerequisites # A server running Docker. Checkout our docker guide to get this going. Portainer installed and accessible via web UI (If you\u0026rsquo;re using Unraid, Kubernetes, or anything else checkout the docs.) Recommended 6GB of ram and 4 core CPU. (lean more) Enough storage for your media. I have 4TB of space setup for this. Your needed ammount will depending on your photography habits and current media collection. NOTE: Most of the steps below are from their official docs. Please check those out as well.\nStep 1: Prepare Your Environment # Create directories for Immich data. The commands below are just an example of creating in my home directory. You may want to change the library location to a network dive or another location if your root file system has less storage than you may need. Checkout this example of mounting a drives in Linux. mkdir -p ~/docker/immich/{library,postgres} (Adjust paths according to your preferences)\nNote your server\u0026rsquo;s IP address or domain name. You can use ip a to find this. Step 2: Create Immich Stack in Portainer # Log into Portainer UI Go to Stacks \u0026gt; Add Stack Name: immich Build Method: Web Editor Paste in the lastest release of their compose.yaml from Github. A step required for Protainer is to replace any instance of .env with stack.env Be sure to checkout the Portainer Steps in their docs.\nStep 3: Configuration Adjustments # Click on \u0026ldquo;Advanced Mode\u0026rdquo; in the Environment Variables section.\nCopy and paste the content of their example.env into the editor.\nSwitch back to \u0026ldquo;Simple Mode\u0026rdquo;.\nMandatory Changes:\nChange DB_PASSWORD with a random string/strong password.

Example: Group all iPhone photos by year/month or separate DSLR shots by camera model. Flexibility:\nUse variables like {{DATE}}, {{TIME}}, {{CAMERA}}, or {{FILENAME}} to create dynamic paths. Example template: /Photos/{{DATE:YYYY}}/{{DATE:MMMM}}-{{DATE:DD}}/{{CAMERA}}_{{DATE:HHmmss}} Generates: /Photos/2024/July-15/Nikon-Z6_143045.jpg Consistency:\nEliminate manual folder creation—Immich handles it every time you upload. Future-Proof Backups:\nStructured folders make it easier to sync with cloud storage (e.g., Backblaze, S3) or external drives. Multi-User Support:\nAssign unique templates for different users (e.g., /Family/Jane/{{DATE}} vs. /Family/John/{{DATE}}). How to Set Up Storage Templates # Step 1: Access Storage Templates\nLog into your Immich web UI. Go to Settings (gear icon) \u0026gt; Storage Template. Step 2: Build Your Template\nUse variables in the Template field. Supported variables include:\n{{DATE}} # 2024-07-15 {{DATE:YYYY}} # 2024 {{DATE:MMMM}} # July {{TIME}} # 14:30:45 {{CAMERA}} # Nikon Z6 {{FILENAME}} # IMG_1234.jpg {{USERNAME}} # jane_doe Example Templates:\nBy Year/Month: /Photos/{{DATE:YYYY}}/{{DATE:MMMM}} By Camera + Date: /Photos/{{CAMERA}}/{{DATE:YYYY}}-{{DATE:MM}}-{{DATE:DD}} For Events: /Events/{{ALBUM_NAME}}/{{DATE:YYYY}} Step 3: Apply the Template\nFor New Uploads:\nEnable Apply template to new uploads to auto-organize future media. For Existing Libraries:\nGo to Library \u0026gt; Select your library \u0026gt; Re-run Storage Template. Immich will reorganize files according to the new rules. Step 4: Test and Refine\nUpload a test photo to verify the folder structure. Tweak the template if needed (e.g., add {{TIME}} to avoid filename conflicts).

It’s not just used for handling source code though, but also configuration files, documentation, images, and more. That means that even if you never touch source code, there are still plenty of useful reasons to learn some Git basics.\nSo this is an introduction to Git for “everyone else”, those of us who aren’t using Git every day as an integral part of our professional workflow. We’ll cover the commands and procedures that are most relevant when using Git on an occasional basis. And hopefully you’ll also get a glimpse into why it can be valuable to commit to learning a even a bit more about this powerful piece of software.\nThese days it’s hard to say much about Git without also mentioning Github. Like Git itself, Github has also become a de facto standard for software development. You can think of Github as a Git hosting service with additional collaboration features. There are of course alternatives to Github, including open source options that you can self host. To name a few, there’s Gitlab, Gitea, and SourceHut.\nFor the most part though, Git hosting services all have a similar feature set to Github, with some even sharing a similar visual appearance and layout. So anything you learn about Github is largely transferrable and we’ll use it for showing examples of how to interact with a Git hosting service.\nWhat is Version Control? Why Git? # Note: this section has some background information on Git that I’m confident most nerds will find fascinating. However, you can safely skip ahead to the next section where the tutorial begins, if you prefer.\nNot everyone knows that Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds for use in developing Linux. At the time, existing version control systems were not open source and there were ongoing disputes over the licensing and restricted use of Git’s predecessors. So in true promethean fashion, Linus went ahead and invented another of the world’s most popular pieces of software and gave it away for free.\nNow the rest of us mere mortals can try to learn and understand Git, which to be honest isn’t so easy. Despite being obviously capable and robust, Git has a reputation for being rather complex and not particularly user friendly. There are other open source version control systems that popped up around the same time as Git, such as Mercurial and Fossil. Some people prefer the alternatives and think they are easier to use, but Git is by far the most popular.\nSo, what exactly can you do with a version control system? The short answer is that it’s essentially an advanced form of the undo and redo buttons found in many applications. If you ever tried collaborating on a document by emailing copies back and forth, or if you ever saved a document with a title like Essay-Final-v2-ReallyFinal-NotKiddingReallyFinalThisTime.doc, then you understand the main problems that tools like Git solve.\nThe version history and collaboration features popularized by Google Docs are an example of the core features of version control software like Git applied in the context of editing documents. However, with Git you have complete control over which versions the system remembers, and rather than just being able to move forward and backward through a single path of changes, it’s possible to create a branching tree of histories.\nIf you’re already thinking that this is starting to sound complicated, don’t worry–we haven’t even gotten to the parts of Git that users consider too complex when compared to other version control systems. Jokes aside, there’s plenty you can do with Git while keeping it simple and that’s what we’ll focus on here.\nGitting Started # While it’s actually possible to use Git in a limited fashion entirely within the web UI of Github or another Git hosting service, installing Git is generally the first step when using it.\nIf you use a Debian based operating system like Ubuntu, installing Git is as simple as apt install git. It’s also available via the package managers of all major Linux distributions. For MacOS and Windows, you can find information and links for how to install Git at the official downloads page.\nOnce you completed the relevant steps for your operating system, make sure you have a working install by running this command in a shell:\ngit version\nAssuming you see an output with a version number, you are all good.\nCloning a Git Repository # Rather than starting fresh, I’ll first demonstrate how to take an existing Git repository and make it your own. Now you might rightly be wondering what a repository is. You can think of a repository (or “repo”) as a group of files and folders that are tracked by Git as a logical unit. A repository generally represents a project, such as the code for an, the content of a website, or a book (yes some people use Git to write books).\nOn your computer, a repository is basically just a folder that contains some special files generated by Git. Any files in this folder or its subfolders can be tracked by Git as part of this repo, but not every file has to be tracked. On the other hand, it’s not possible to add files to the repo which are outside the root folder of the repo.\nFor this example we will download a copy of a repository we used in a recent guide on server monitoring with Grafana. If you’re curious about the contents, go check out that guide next, but otherwise don’t worry these are just some example files to play with.\nIn Git, copying a repository is called “cloning” and it works like this:\ngit clone https://github.com/TechHutTV/server-monitoring.git Now you have a folder called server-monitoring that contains the latest version of what’s hosted in this repository on Github. You can cd in and have a look around:\ncd server-monitoring ls Compare to what you see if you visit the repository on Github. Any .git link you see that starts with https is generally also going to be a link to the repository’s page, when you remove the .git. One thing to notice is that this repository has a default branch called “main”. That’s both the first branch we see on Github and also the branch that Git selects when we clone the repo (shown in parenthesis in the screenshot above). Branches are especially useful for collaboration and advanced uses of Git. For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll just stick with the default branch.\nMaking and Committing Edits # Okay, so now we have a copy of this repository on our local machine. Let’s go wild! We can see that there’s a README.md file. By convention, any file with this name will get rendered and shown below the file list on Github, both at the top level and subfolders of the repo. Markdown is pretty self explanatory, so we can just jump in here and start editing.\nLet’s start by changing the heading. Since this is my repo now, I want to make that clear. Open README.md in your favorite text editor, and add your name to the first line, like this:\nnano README.md Save the file (ctrl-o, enter, ctrl-x in Nano) and return to a shell within the repository. Now let’s store this change with Git:\ngit add README.md git commit -m \u0026#34;Update README.md\u0026#34; Depending on your system setup, Git will probably complain that it doesn’t know your name and maybe also your email address. Keep in mind that if you ever share a repository publicly or contribute to a public repository, the email address you use with Git will also become public. You can enter a fake email address if you want–Git doesn’t care, and this feature is really just for attribution and collaboration purposes. These days most conversations about the contents of Git repos happens on Git hosting sites, rather than by email.\nAnyway, just follow the directions Git prints on screen to set a global name and email to use with all repositories:\ngit config --global user.email \u0026#34;you@example.com\u0026#34; git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; With that, try the commit again:\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;Update README.md\u0026quot;\nIf all went well this time, Git will print some information about the commit to the screen. That will include some random looking letters and numbers known as the commit hash, which we’ll cover later, the number of files changed, and also the commit message. Here we specified the commit message by writing -m and then wrapping the message in quotation marks. It’s also possible to write the commit message into a text editor by shortening the command to git commit. Either way, just try to keep commit messages short and sweet.\nA Few Words on Commitment # Alright, that was fun, but what is a commit? A commit is a snapshot of the state of files that are being tracked by Git in the repository. Whenever a new commit is created, it means that some files in the repository changed, new files were added, or some files were moved or removed. When you change files that were previously committed, you then have uncommitted changes. When you have files in the repo folder that have never been committed, those are untracked files.\nTo get a quick overview of whether there are any uncommitted changes or untracked files in the repository, use this command:\ngit status\nThe working tree is clean with nothing to commit:\nIn other words, there have been no changes since the last commit and all files present are committed in their current state. That’s to be expected, because all the files we have are either in the same state as when we cloned them or in the case of README.md the changes are committed.\nNext let’s create a new file and start tracking it with Git. The touch command creates an empty file if no file by the given name exists:\ntouch newfile\nBefore committing this file, let’s try git status again. Now we can see that Git has detected the new file:\nLike before, we’ll use git add to prepare the file to be committed and then check git status again:\ngit add newfile git status At this point, the new file now appears under Changes to be committed, letting us know it would be included in the next commit we make. If we changed our mind, we could follow the helpful hint Git has printed on screen and use the restore command, but let’s not try that at the moment.\nWhen we use the add command on a file, it enters the staging area. On each commit command, the staged files are included in the commit. It’s a bit more nuanced than that though, because actually it’s the contents of the file at the time the add command was run that go into the commit. If we change a file and want to commit the changes, we need to run the add command again.\nFor example, let’s write the word “hi” into newfile:\necho hi \u0026gt; newfile\nThis is equivalent to opening the file in a text editor, writing “hi” and saving it. Now we can see that Git has noticed the change if we run git status again:\nIf we want to include the updated file in our next commit, we use add:\ngit add newfile git commit -m \u0026#34;Added newfile\u0026#34; Now all changes are committed and the working tree is again clean.\nThe Log # We’ve made a couple of commits since cloning this repository. Let’s have a look now at Git’s history for this repository:\ngit log\nWhat we see are our two commits at the top, and below that the history of the repo from before when we cloned it. This is a standard pager view, which responds to the arrow keys or vi style navigation with the j and k keys.\nEach commit is labeled with a long string of letters and numbers. This is the commit hash, and it’s guaranteed to be unique for every commit in this repo. If you recall, a shorter version of the hash is also shown when creating each commit. In general, it’s okay to substitute an abbreviated version of the hash, as long as it starts from the beginning (left side) and is long enough to still be unique.\nHashes are like version numbers. Every commit has a hash and every hash refers to exactly the contents of one commit. Beside some of the hashes are additional labels. These show the state of both our local copy and the “origin” where we cloned the repo from. We can see intuitively that our local copy is two commits ahead of the version we cloned from GitHub.\nCreating a fork # So far we have only made edits to our local copy of the repository. Syncing those changes back to Github can serve as a backup and also allow us to share them with others. Since we aren’t the owner of the original remote repository on Github, we can’t upload our changes directly. Instead, we’ll need our own repository on our own account.\nFor this, go ahead and sign into Github if you haven’t already. It’s quick and easy to get a free account that you can do quite a lot with. If you prefer not to use Github, you could also use another Git hosting service with a few changes to the steps below, but I won’t cover that in detail.\nLet’s navigate back to the page for the repository we cloned earlier. We are going to make a fork of this repository, which is essentially just a copy. While cloning a repo makes a copy on our local machine, forking a repo creates a copy on Github. One thing to note is that forks of public repos will always be public in Github. If you prefer a private repo, you can accomplish that in a couple ways, including Github’s import feature.\nTo proceed with a fork, click the Fork button in the upper right hand corner of the page:\nYou can choose to change the name if you want, but accepting the default here is just fine. Hit the green Create Fork button to continue:\nGithub will take a moment to prepare your fork and then you’ll automatically end up on the page for your new repository. At this point, the new repository is identical to the original one but we are now able to upload our changes to it. In Git terminology, uploading changes to a remote Git host is called a “push”. Likewise, we can also “pull” changes that exist in the remote copy but not our local copy.\nA Note on Git Authentication # What we’ll do now is configure our local repository to point to the fork we just created instead of the original repo. There’s a bit of a fork in the road here, depending on how you want to authenticate with Github. To push changes, we’ll need to prove our identity somehow.\nThe best way to authenticate with Github, or any remote Git host for that matter, is SSH using an SSH public key. However, that requires some initial setup on your local machine, which will vary based on your operating system. Setting up SSH is outside the scope of this guide, so instead I’ll show how to authenticate using a token.\nIf you are already comfortable using SSH with public keys and have that set up on your local system, you could also go add your SSH key to Github now, by following their docs. In that case, skip over the next section and keep an eye out for a note on one small change in the steps that follow.\nGenerating a Github Token # Using token based authentication is convenient because we don’t need to worry about setting up SSH, but it’s also more of a developer oriented feature that’s somewhat buried in the Github settings. You can follow this link to go directly to the token management page.\nWe’ll use Tokens (Classic) from the left nav bar for a slightly simpler experience. Then click the Generate new token button and select Generate new token (Classic):\nEnter a name for your token in the note field, select an expiration date, and check the repo box. This will allow repo based actions, like push, using this token.\nThen scroll down and hit the green Generate Token button. Copy the token and store it somewhere secure, like a password manager. You won’t be able to view this particular token again in the future, but you can always generate another one.\nPushing to the Fork # Back on the Github page of your fork, click the green Code button. Then copy the HTTPS address for the repo. If you’re using SSH, select the SSH tab and copy the address there instead.\nInside the repo folder on your local machine, edit the file .git/config:\n```nano .git/config``\nYou’ll see a URL line with the existing Github address. Just replace the address with the one you copied from your own repository, and save the file.\nWith that completed, we can now try a push:\ngit push\nEnter your username and when prompted for a password, enter the token you generated earlier. Once the push is complete, you can head back to Github to see the result.\nOur changes are now hosted on Github. Nice.\nWe can share the Github link and then anyone can clone the fork or make their own… “subfork”? You get the idea.\nAnother cool aspect of public repos is that they can also be copied onto other machines with a simple git clone. So if you wanted to use these files on a server or VM, just install git, copy the HTTPS link, and clone the repo. Since that’s a read only operation, no authentication is required.\nAccessing History # While sharing files with other people and other computers is cool, Git is after all a version control system. So let’s wrap up by seeing how Git can save our bacon when some change goes awry or allow us to get a feel for how a repository has changed over time.\nGit of course has rich command line tools for dealing with history and restoring older versions. However, this (already long) guide isn’t about how to become a Git CLI pro. So instead we’ll just look at how to access history inside of Github (or your Git hosting service of choice, which will have a similar interface).\nVisiting the repo page, we see a history button that shows the total number of commits in the current branch.\nClicking that pulls up a display that’s something like git log. We see the history of commits and who created them.\nClicking on the title of the commit will show the changes in that commit, versus the one before it. That can be a useful view, but it won’t show us whole files as they were at the point of the commit. To do that, click the browse files button.\nNow we are back in the main view of the repo, but the branch name has been replaced with the commit hash of the commit we’re viewing. We can always return to the most recent changes by clicking there and selecting the branch name.\nFrom here we can select files in the repo to see their previous state, as of the selected commit. Github’s toolbar has various options for viewing Markdown files, included preview and code view. There’s also buttons to view or download a copy of the raw text.\nSo using these features, it’s always possible to revisit the past and retrieve a copy of the files as they were then. You can download or copy these versions onto your local machine and commit their contents into the repository to revert back to a previous state. Again I’ll note that Git has commands for dealing with history and reverting changes, so if you’re curious to explore more, by all means go ahead.\nConclusion # In this guide we covered the basics of using Git with a Git hosting service like Github to start adding changes to an existing repository and push them to our own fork. This is a solid foundation, but if you’re curious, well, it feels like there’s always more to learn about Git.\nWhat’s next? Maybe you’re feeling inspired to start your own repository from scratch. While we didn’t cover that specifically in this guide, you now have all the tools to do it, and a fresh repo is just a few clicks away in Github. Or, find another repo to fork. The power is yours.\n","date":"February 3, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/git-for-everyone-guide/","section":"2025s","summary":"","title":"Git for Everyone","type":"2025"},{"content":"","date":"February 3, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/github/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Github","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"February 3, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/guides/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Guides","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"February 3, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/scott-yeager/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Scott Yeager","type":"authors"},{"content":"You may have seen one of those Lightweight Windows ISOs out there such as Tiny 11, and AtlasOS. These are custom Windows ISOs that debloat Windows, remove things like Windows 11’s ads and copilot, take up less disk space, RAM, and system resources, So, these custom ISOs like Tiny11 are becoming relatively popular.\nBUT. I do not recommend these custom ISOs. For one, many of these ISOs disable core features, for example Tiny11 Core disables Windows Defender, Windows Update, and the WIndows Component Store. That is an extreme example because the Tiny11 developers don’t even recommend using the Core variant of Tiny11, but the point is, these ISOs are usually outdated, break things like Windows Update, and you don’t know what random things people are going to do to these ISOs. On top of that, you’re getting no support at all from Microsoft, and with all the weird mods and hacks they often break. They’re also straight illegal. You probably won’t get in trouble for just installing Tiny11, but if you are caught distributing it, than don’t be surprised if you find yourself in prison for 15 months.\nWindows LTSC # But what if I told you Microsoft made a Lite version of Windows itself, that’s right, you don’t need a Tiny11 because Microsoft has an official version that some even may call “Windows Lite”. This is Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 with LTSC standing for Long-Term Servicing Channel. This is a version of Windows designed to be as stable as possible. It is commonly used in devices like medical systems, air traffic control devices, or ATMs. It is not faster than standard Windows 11, although it does use less resources out of the box since it comes debloated. And, we can make it faster with some modifications. Also, as a bonus, each Windows LTSC build is supported for 10 years, although it’s only security updates and not feature updates. But also the lack of feature updates might be seen as a good thing by some. After all, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC doesn’t come with all the AI bloat or ads, or anything.\nAlso, as another bonus, Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC doesn’t have the TPM requirement which means you can run it on your old hardware without doing any weird ISO tricks.\nThe Catch # So what’s the catch? Well, it is very difficult for a normal person to legally obtain a copy of Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC. It is only available through Volume Licensing Agreements meaning that you need to be an organization buying Windows licenses in bulk to get it. If you want to go the illegal route, there are websites online that link to official Microsoft download URLs for ISOs that are probably supposed to be hidden behind subscriptions, so through those official links it is possible to obtain a clean copy, but I cannot show you where to find those links. Aldo After getting an ISO, you still need to find a way to activate it too. Reddit may or may not be a good place to find the ISO and activation methods. For this guide, I am using the official Evaluation copy that you can find on Microsoft’s website. This is free on their website, but you only get a 90 day period to evaluate it. After the 90 days, the desktop background will turn black, you will see a persistent desktop notification indicating that the system is not genuine, and the PC will shut down every hour. If you just want to tinker with this version of Windows for a bit this is the safest way to get an ISO.\nStill, even if you are going the illegal route of sailing the Seven Seas, which I do not recommend, it is still safer than using a modified Windows ISO made from someone you don’t know that Microsoft doesn’t officially support, and you don’t 100% know what changes have been made to it.\nThe other catch is much smaller. They usually only have new release every 3 years, and during that wait time, older hardware is not going to be supported between releases. Also you won’t be getting major feature updates.\nThe Perfect “Windows Lite” Installation # The Windows 11 IoT installation is the same as a standard installation, so I am going to skip until the account screen. One of the nice things about this version of Windows is we can use a local account easily.\nJust click on Sign In Options than -\u0026gt; Domain Join instead.\nAlso be sure to disable all the Windows telemetry in the Windows setup screen:\nNow that it is installed, if we open the start menu, as you can see barely anything is preinstalled, and some of the things that are preinstalled such as the Calculator, Notepad, and Paint are older Windows 7 apps. But we can do a few tweaks and make this even better. Disabling Telemetry # Now, on the privacy side, we are just going to disable telemetry real quick. All we have to do is open the group policy editor, navigate to Local Computer Policy -\u0026gt; Computer Configuration -\u0026gt; Administrative Templates -\u0026gt; Windows Components -\u0026gt; Data Collection and Preview Builds. Then double click on “Allow Diagnostic Data”. In the allow diagnostic data window, we are actually going to click enabled, but than go to the dropdown options and select “Diagnostic data off (not recommended)”. Now we have telemetry disabled and we can move on to some other improvements.\nInstalling The Windows Store \u0026amp; Modern Windows Apps # This version of Windows 11 doesn’t come with the Windows Store, but chances are eventually you probably want to install an app off the Windows Store. And if you plan on doing any gaming, it’s kind of mandatory because of the Xbox app. Luckily it’s very easy to install. Just right click the start menu, and click Windows Powershell (Admin) Now inside Powershell just type wsreset \\-i. It will appear like nothing happened, however after a few minutes you will get a notification that the store was installed, and it should appear. After installing the Windows Store, we recommend installing the App Installer incase you need to install an AppX or MSIX file. This also installs WinGet which allows you to install apps very quickly in the command line with winget install \\\u0026lt;app\\_name\\\u0026gt; such as winget install Mozilla.Firefox which can make getting your Windows System up and running fast. To install it, head over to https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4nns1 and just click install. It will open it in the Windows Store.\nAfter installing that, you will also be able to install the WIndows 11 versions of systems apps if you prefer. To do so open the command line, and the following commands install different modern apps.\nWindows Camera: winget install 9WZDNCRFJBBG Modern Calculator: winget install 9WZDNCRFHVN5 Windows 11 Clock: winget install 9WZDNCRFJ3PR Modern Mail and Calendar: winget install 9WZDNCRFHVQM Windows Maps: winget install 9WZDNCRDTBVB Modern Media Player: winget install 9WZDNCRFJ3PT Movies and TV: winget install 9WZDNCRFJ3P2 Microsoft News: winget install 9WZDNCRFHVFW Modern Notepad: winget install 9MSMLRH6LZF3 Modern Paint: winget install 9PCFS5B6T72H Microsoft People winget install 9NBLGGH10PG8 Modern Photos App: winget install 9WZDNCRFJBH4 Windows 11 Snipping Tool: winget install 9MZ95KL8MR0L Microsoft Sticky Notes: winget install 9NBLGGH4QGHW Windows Sound Recorder: winget install 9WZDNCRFHWKN Windows Terminal: winget install 9N0DX20HK701 Microsoft To Do winget install 9NBLGGH5R558 Microsoft Whiteboard:winget install 9MSPC6MP8FM4 MSN Weather: winget install 9WZDNCRFJ3Q2 If you want to remove the legacy apps after installing a modern app, you can go to Settings -\u0026gt; System -\u0026gt; and Optional Features.\nAlso if you plan on doing any gaming I highly recommend installing the Xbox app because several games need it: winget install 9MV0B5HZVK9Z\nWhile we are at it, winget is an excellent way to easily install any other apps you need, including apps not on the Windows Store. I like to use the https://winstall.app/ website, where you select all the apps you want from the winget repository and it generates a command you can copy and paste which installs all your apps.\n# Extra Tweaks # Now, let’s make a couple more tweaks to make it snappier. First off, let\u0026rsquo;s remove Edge from the startup. So, let’s hit Control-Shift-ESC to open task manager, head over to startup, and remove Edge from the startup. Now, lets disable a bunch of animations and things just to make Windows 11 Super Snappy and make everything feel instant. Open the start menu, type “adjust the appearance and performance of Windows” and open that. Now, I’m going to click on “Adjust for best performance which will uncheck everything, but than I’m going to check a few extra options just so Windows doesn’t look like crap. Additionally, let’s go into Windows Settings and just turn off animations and transparency in Accessibility -\u0026gt; Visual effects.\nDisabling Animations just speed things up cause you don’t have to wait for the slight delay of the animation itself, and disabling transparency will use less of your computer’s graphics.\n","date":"February 3, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/windows-lite-ltsc-microsoft/","section":"2025s","summary":"","title":"the OFFICIAL Windows (lite) from Microsoft","type":"2025"},{"content":"","date":"February 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/essay/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Essay","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"February 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/essay/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Essay","type":"tags"},{"content":" Why on Earth Would You Need a Home Server? # Whether you\u0026rsquo;re just dipping your toes into the world of home servers or you\u0026rsquo;re an IT professional, there are plenty of reasons to consider setting one up. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s for fun, to break free from the grip of big tech, or simply to explore new possibilities, here are five compelling reasons to get started. And no, you don’t need a massive rack-mounted server—your setup could be as simple as a NAS, a Raspberry Pi, a budget mini PC, or even an old computer lying around.\nLocal File Backups and Sharing # You don’t have to ditch cloud storage entirely. I still keep backups of important files on Google Drive, for example. But relying solely on the cloud comes with risks. Companies can change their policies, or worse, flag your files as copyrighted without justification. That’s why I keep everything on a NAS (Network Attached Storage) and use the cloud as a secondary backup for critical data. This dual approach gives me peace of mind—if one fails, I still have the other.\nThere’s also a cost-saving angle. Instead of paying $10 a month for 4TB of cloud storage, you could spend $80 on a 4TB hard drive and run it on an old computer. Plus, local storage means your files are always accessible, even if your internet goes down.\nAnother perk? Network shares. For instance, my MacBook Air has only 256GB of storage, and Apple charges a fortune for upgrades. With a NAS, I don’t need to store large files locally. Instead, I can set my project or download directories to point directly to the network share. With a solid Ethernet connection, the speed difference is negligible—even when using demanding software like DaVinci Resolve.\nMedia Streaming # A home server lets you self-host your movies, TV shows, music, eBooks, and more. If you\u0026rsquo;re Chromecasting everything to your TV, this might not seem essential. But if you want to create your own personal Netflix—accessible to friends and family—or simply have a native app that instantly streams your media to multiple devices, this is a game-changer.\nThere are several excellent tools for self-hosted media streaming, including Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin. All three are fantastic for media organization and device syncing. If you’re curious about getting started, check out our video comparing Plex and Jellyfin or our guide on turning an old PC into a media server with Plex.\nBeyond video streaming, there are specialized tools for other types of media. For example, Navidrome lets you host your own music with a Spotify-like interface (video guide here), and Podgrab automatically downloads new podcast episodes for streaming (video guide here). I also recommend Overseerr, which helps you discover new content to add to your media library.\nDNS and VPN Services # Next up: hosting your own DNS and VPN services. DNS servers translate domain names like \u0026ldquo;techhut.tv\u0026rdquo; into IP addresses. While you can use public DNS services like Google’s (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare’s (1.1.1.1), running your own DNS server with tools like PiHole has unique advantages.\nPiHole is a DNS service that blocks ad-serving domains across your entire network, effectively giving you network-wide ad blocking. It’s also customizable for web filtering and monitoring, making it great for blocking distracting sites, tracking network activity, or setting up parental controls.\nImage sourced from Wikimedia\nYou can also use your home server to run a VPN. This isn’t the same as paid VPN services like Private Internet Access or NordVPN, and it won’t help much with privacy or torrenting. However, it’s perfect for securely accessing your local network services without exposing them to the open internet. It’s also handy for creating an encrypted tunnel on public Wi-Fi or accessing your home country’s internet while abroad—especially useful for streaming services that block VPNs.\nLearning and Homelab # A home server is an excellent platform for creating a \u0026ldquo;homelab\u0026rdquo;—a sandbox for learning and experimentation. With software like Unraid, you can run containers and virtual machines to test new projects. For example, if you come across a cool tool like Penpot (a design app that was trending on GitHub when I wrote this), you can spin up a Docker container in Unraid and try it out. If you don’t like it, simply delete the container—it’s like it was never there.\nRun Your Own Internet # One of the best reasons to have a home server is the ability to maintain your own \u0026ldquo;internet\u0026rdquo; if your main connection goes down. With the right setup, you can keep many services running locally. For example, did you know the entirety of Wikipedia, including images, is only about 110 GB? With tools like Kiwix, you can download entire wikis—like the Archwiki, AskUbuntu, or Stack Overflow—for offline viewing. Combine that with your media library, security cameras, and file storage, and you’ve got a self-sufficient system. Even during an apocalypse, you’ll still be able to binge-watch The Office.\nSo, why bother with a home server? Whether it’s for backup, media, learning, or just having fun, the possibilities are endless. And the best part? You don’t need a fortune or a data center to get started. All it takes is a little curiosity and some old hardware.\n","date":"February 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/5-reasons-build-home-server/","section":"2025s","summary":"","title":"EVERYONE needs a Home Server","type":"2025"},{"content":"","date":"August 29, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2024/","section":"2024s","summary":"","title":"2024s","type":"2024"},{"content":"For over a year I have been using Microsoft Edge. In my testing it is the most performant browser ranked against many others and with the integration of ChatGPT and many other helpful features I just stuck with the Windows default. A few weeks ago, I started using Firefox off and on, but it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like the best workspace to be in. I love the Firefox engine, but the user interface just isn\u0026rsquo;t it for me. Then I stumbled on this video by Theo that introduced me to Zen.\nWhat is Zen # You can think of Zen as what Edge is to Chrome or even what Ubuntu is to Debian. It\u0026rsquo;s new browser that uses the engine of Firefox to give us a new browsing experience. Their homepage states: \u0026ldquo;Beautifully designed, privacy-focused, and packed with features. We care about your experience, not your data.\u0026rdquo;\nThe browser has a host of UI changes and under the hood tweaks to give users a better browsing experience. We will dive more into some of the features in the moment, But, first lets test some claim that it will preform better than other browsers. They do have some benchmark results posted, but I want to compare with other browsers.\nWith my testing I can see why they didn\u0026rsquo;t have comparison scores on their webpage. It\u0026rsquo;s still behind Chromium based powers in most testing. However, it is nice to see the browser taking the lead over Firefox in Basemark Web. Meaning that there have been improvements made compared to the browser running the same engine. Zen is still behind on the more specific tests. With this as an alpha release I\u0026rsquo;m not going to stress this too hard as the differences are marginal and some are within the margin of error.\nFeatures # Many of these feature can be found in many other browsers, but most of all of those that I know of are chromium based browsers. This is the first time I\u0026rsquo;d seems some of these implemented as a Firefox front end with such a modern feeling UI\nCustomization # The way theming is done is the first I\u0026rsquo;ve seen. When you apply a theme from their store it immediately makes changes as if all the customization and themes are preinstalled. You can checkout their theme store to see all the different themes and tweaks. Some of these include modifying the bookmark toolbar, and a floating URL bar, private mode theming, and removing browser padding. This is in addition to the custom color schemes available and the built in theming options you get.\nThis seems to be done with simple CSS files that modify the appearance and UI. For example, an option within the theme store is to disable rounded corners. If we browse their theme store Github page we can see how this is being done.\n:root .browserSidebarContainer { margin: unset!important; box-shadow: unset!important; clip-path: unset!important; border-radius: unset!important; overflow: unset!important; } Being that this is so new and quickly gaining popularity, I look forward to seeing what the community comes up with to improve and add to what Zen offers.\nSplit View # I love split view, this is probably mt favorite feature of any browser. As I\u0026rsquo;m on macOS more than I\u0026rsquo;d prefer it\u0026rsquo;s nice not to replay on Apples crappy window management. Zen has a nice split view mode that offers side-by-side, tiling, and horizontal layout options. To enable split view you need to select multiple tabs by hold shift, right click, and split them. You can see the default key bindings below to actually switch between these modes.\nUnfortunately, that seems to it be it. I cant figure out how to move them, resize the spaces and take one tab out of the view without closing it. More options, presets, and key binding added to these split view options would make this great.\nSide Bar # This is a neat little panel that can be shown at any time. It has it\u0026rsquo;s own bookmarks and tab system. Basically feels like a small independent mobile browser within your desktop browsers. Making browsing sites like Twitter, YouTube, and even your email provider nice and handy.\nYou can pin it or have it floating about the desktop content, close it and quickly re-open to where you last were, and when you add a new website to the sidebar there is an option to force it to be in mobile view.\nTry it # https://youtu.be/ppdzVvzOMrc?si=ZAZlztFmj1Ot8koG\nNow we didn\u0026rsquo;t go over all the features here. For example, Workspaces, compact mode, and all the various improvements. I highly recommend checking out their Github, going through their documentation, and viewing the release notes. Zen is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux as a flatpak.\nZen Browser # Download now and experience the Zen Browser\n","date":"August 29, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zen-browser-better-firefox/","section":"2024s","summary":"","title":"Zen browser is making me DITCH Microsoft Edge","type":"2024"},{"content":"Today I\u0026rsquo;ll be showing you how it can actually be pretty simple to get a self hosted monitoring system set up for your home lab. The idea is to collect and visualize key data about your machines, like how much CPU, RAM, and disk capacity is being used over time.\nHaving monitoring in place can be really useful for understanding if there are adequate resources dedicated to your various services, and it can also just be a lot of fun to look at. Before we go any further, here\u0026rsquo;s a sample screen shot of what our end result will look like:\nGrafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter # What you\u0026rsquo;re looking at above is a Grafana dashboard. In the IT industry, Grafana has become essentially the standard tool for visualizing various performance metrics both about systems and services themselves. But it\u0026rsquo;s definitely not limited to that domain, and you\u0026rsquo;ll also see Grafana being used sometimes in home monitoring and home automation setups. So that\u0026rsquo;s to say that it\u0026rsquo;s a valuable tool to learn which we\u0026rsquo;ll really just scratch the surface of in this tutorial.\nWhen it comes to monitoring computers, whether those are bare metal systems or virtual machines, Grafana is commonly paired with another industry standard tool known as Prometheus. The role of Prometheus is gathering data points at regular intervals in a process known as \u0026ldquo;scraping\u0026rdquo;. That data is then made available to Grafana to be visualized in the dashboard.\nThe full deployment consists of two main aspects. First are the Grafana and Prometheus services which in this case we\u0026rsquo;ll be running in Docker containers. Second is what\u0026rsquo;s known at the \u0026ldquo;node exporter\u0026rdquo; service that is part of the Prometheus project. The exporter runs on each machine to be monitored and makes the machine\u0026rsquo;s metrics available to be scraped by the main Prometheus app.\nThat also means of course that all of the machines in the monitoring group need to be reachable in the same network as the machine hosting the Prometheus Docker container. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if that\u0026rsquo;s a regular LAN or some kind of private overlay networking solution. There are more advanced options, like connecting multiple Prometheus instances together or using authenticated connections over the public internet, but we won\u0026rsquo;t cover any of that here.\nInfluxDB and Telegraf # InfluxDB and Telegraf and very similar to Prometheus and the Node Exporter. The reason I\u0026rsquo;m adding these tools to the step up is because it gives us more options to gather data to visualize with Grafana. While there are many services that provide direct support for Prometheus, that\u0026rsquo;s not always the case. Telegraf has a wide range of plugins and for some services it\u0026rsquo;s just a more natural fit than Prometheus. Having both of them set up means that you\u0026rsquo;ll likely have a very simple way to get started with monitoring anything in your lab with one or the other.\nInfluxDB is a specialized time-series database designed to store and manage data indexed and queried by time. It’s particularly useful for handling metrics, events, and other time-based data. InfluxDB provides a query language called InfluxQL and APIs for retrieving and analyzing time-series data. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if that sounds like a lot—you don\u0026rsquo;t need to write queries or use the API directly to do awesome things. In fact, the UI of InfluxDB is rather nice as you\u0026rsquo;ll see below and it works as a standalone visualization tool too.\nTelegraf, on the other hand, is an open-source server agent developed by InfluxData, the same people behind InfluxDB. Its main purpose is to collect and send metrics and events from various sources, including databases, systems, and IoT sensors. It offers a wide range of input plugins (300+ community-contributed) and can be customized to collect data from cloud platforms, containers, and more. Telegraf is especially useful when paired with InfluxDB, as it efficiently sends collected metrics to the database for storage and analysis.\nInstalling and Starting Node Exporter # The Prometheus node exporter is widely available as a package in the official repos of various Linux distros. To start we will be installing this Exporter on the same machine that we plan on running with our stack. For Ubuntu and other Debian based distros, you can install it like this:\nsudo apt install prometheus-node-exporter While apt should start and enable the systemd service for the node exporter automatically, you can double check that like this:\nsudo systemctl status prometheus-node-exporter As an aside, you might be wondering why we\u0026rsquo;re using a system package for the node exporter while using Docker containers for the rest. While it\u0026rsquo;s true that the node exporter can run inside a container too, doing so limits the visibility it has into the system\u0026rsquo;s resources, particularly disk space. Using a system package is the simplest way to ensure that all the data is available.\nMonitoring Linux host metrics with the Node Exporter | Prometheus # An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.\nDeploying the Docker Containers # Alright, now let\u0026rsquo;s get started with the deployment of the containers. For this part I\u0026rsquo;ll assume you have a machine set up with Docker already. If not, we have an article and video on getting started with Docker that will get you up to speed. What I\u0026rsquo;ll show here is using a Docker Compose file and Docker\u0026rsquo;s command line interface.\n7 Docker Basics for Beginners February 6, 2024\u0026middot;2333 words\u0026middot;11 mins Brandon Hopkins ,\u0026nbsp; Scott Yeager Docker is a platform that allows you to work with containers and containerized applications\u0026hellip;.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded my configurations and compose.yaml file to Github making it really easy to clone and get started. I will do my best to keep both this guide and the repository updated with any changes and improvements. Also, if you\u0026rsquo;re following the video guide I will post changes here.\nWhen you clone the repository make sure it\u0026rsquo;s wherever you want some configuration files and scripts for services to be stored. Generally, I just do this in my user home directory.\ngit clone https://github.com/TechHutTV/server-monitoring.git After you pull the repo, it will be in the \u0026lsquo;server-monitoring\u0026rsquo; directory. Now is a good time to rename that if you\u0026rsquo;d like. Now let\u0026rsquo;s move to that directory and see what we\u0026rsquo;re working with.\ncd server-monitoring Now we can see how the included files are laid out:\ntree . ├── compose.yaml ├── grafana │ └── datasource.yml ├── prometheus │ └── prometheus.yml ├── README.md ├── telegraf │ └── telegraf.conf └── unraid ├── README.md ├── telegraf.conf └── unraid-data-preview.png 4 directories, 8 files Docker Compose Configuration # Let\u0026rsquo;s go through each file and cover any changes that you might need to make for your particular setup. First is compose.yaml, which is our Docker Compose file.\nOne thing we added is an extra_hosts section under some of the services. This will enable them to access the data exporters running on the host system outside of Docker by adding an entry to the container\u0026rsquo;s /etc/hosts file. If you have DNS set up for your LAN, then this part is not necessary. You can just substitute the DNS name as needed.\nBelow I show using an example hostname on my test machine of \u0026ldquo;dockerlab\u0026rdquo; but replace this with yours throughout the guide. The important thing to note is that the data will be tagged with this name inside Prometheus as the machine name, and if you change it later, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with multiple entries for the same machine. Using the same name as the host name for this machine is a good idea. To check it, run this in a terminal:\nhostname The volumes are one thing that you might also want to change. With the defaults shown below, all the data collected will be stored in the Docker data directory of the machine running Docker. If you need more space or have another reason to store the data elsewhere, you might consider using a bind mount to networked storage or another disk. Volumes and bind mounts are covered in out Docker guide. Note that Grafana itself stores only a little data for things like settings. The bulk of the data is stored in the Prometheus and InfluxDB data volumes.\nWith that noted, let\u0026rsquo;s jump into the compose file.\nnano compose.yaml Here\u0026rsquo;s what it should look like. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to replace \u0026ldquo;dockerlab\u0026rdquo; with your own host name:\nservices: prometheus: image: prom/prometheus container_name: prometheus command: - \u0026#39;--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml\u0026#39; ports: - 9090:9090 restart: unless-stopped extra_hosts: - \u0026#34;dockerlab:host-gateway\u0026#34; volumes: - ./prometheus:/etc/prometheus - prom_data:/prometheus grafana: image: grafana/grafana container_name: grafana ports: - 3000:3000 restart: unless-stopped volumes: - ./grafana:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources - grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana influxdb: image: influxdb:2.7.6-alpine container_name: influxdb2 ports: - 8086:8086 extra_hosts: - \u0026#34;dockerlab:host-gateway\u0026#34; volumes: - influxdb2_data:/var/lib/influxdb2 - ./influxdb2/config:/etc/influxdb2 - ./influxdb2/scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d telegraf: image: telegraf:latest pid: \u0026#34;host\u0026#34; container_name: telegraf user: telegraf:999 restart: always entrypoint: /bin/bash -c \u0026#34;/entrypoint.sh telegraf\u0026#34; extra_hosts: - \u0026#34;dockerlab:host-gateway\u0026#34; volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock - ./telegraf/telegraf.conf:/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf:ro - /:/hostfs:ro environment: - HOST_ETC=/hostfs/etc - HOST_PROC=/hostfs/proc - HOST_SYS=/hostfs/sys - HOST_VAR=/hostfs/var - HOST_RUN=/hostfs/run - HOST_MOUNT_PREFIX=/hostfs volumes: prom_data: grafana_data: influxdb2_data: Before running this stack ensure there won\u0026rsquo;t be any conflicting network ports. Here we are exposing the default ports: 3000, 9090, and 8086. If any of these ports are already used on your Docker machine, you can edit these as needed by changing the port number to the left of the colon. Since Grafana will access Prometheus and InfluxDB over Docker\u0026rsquo;s internal network, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to change it\u0026rsquo;s configuration when you change the exposed ports. It will only matter when you want to connect to each service directly. Mostly that will be Grafana, but each exposed port has a web UI that we\u0026rsquo;ll be visiting in this guide, so substitute your updated port numbers as needed if you change them.\nPrometheus Configuration # Let\u0026rsquo;s save and close the compose.yaml file, and then go check the Prometheus configuration:\nnano prometheus/prometheus.yml This file already contains some default values, mostly notably a default global scraping interval of 15 seconds. That means that you would get a data point from each machine you are monitoring every 15 seconds.\nglobal: scrape_interval: 15s scrape_timeout: 10s evaluation_interval: 15s This is a reasonable default, but you can edit it if you like. Just note that if you do change the interval, it\u0026rsquo;s important that you also set the same interval inside the Grafana interface later. So, keep that in mind and we\u0026rsquo;ll see where to do it in just a bit.\nalerting: alertmanagers: - static_configs: - targets: [] scheme: http timeout: 10s api_version: v2 After the global settings section at the top, there\u0026rsquo;s an alerts section. Prometheus has the ability to trigger alerts, for example if a disk is getting too full, and actually Grafana has its own separate alerts feature as well. We won\u0026rsquo;t get into that aspect for this tutorial though and so we can leave that part of the config alone.\nscrape_configs: - job_name: prometheus honor_timestamps: true scrape_interval: 15s scrape_timeout: 10s metrics_path: /metrics scheme: http static_configs: - targets: - localhost:9090 Below the alerts section there\u0026rsquo;s the first scraping target, which is actually Prometheus itself. That\u0026rsquo;s right, Prometheus can gather data on itself, such as whether it\u0026rsquo;s experiencing any errors or failures. The data Prometheus gathers on itself is probably more relevant in large scale and high stakes environments, but it won\u0026rsquo;t take up much disk space and you might find it interesting to have at some point.\nWhat we want to do is add an additional job that scrapes the node exporter service running on each machine we want to monitor. Here\u0026rsquo;s the template for what to add:\n- job_name: node_exporter static_configs: - targets: - hostname/IP:9100 This instructs Promethus to scrape data from the node exporter\u0026rsquo;s default port of 9100 on a given host. One important note here is that the data in Grafana will be labeled with the hostname that we write here. So while \u0026ldquo;localhost\u0026rdquo; is a valid target for monitoring the machine that Prometheus is running on, you might find it makes things clearer later if you use the hostname instead. To check the machine\u0026rsquo;s hostname, you can use the `hostname` command in the terminal.\nWe can access a web UI for Prometheus by visiting port 9090 in a web browser. Prometheus includes some of its own graphing capabilities via this interface, but what we\u0026rsquo;re interested in is the Targets view under Status. Here we can see each of the node exporter targets, as well the Prometheus self monitoring target.\nWhen Prometheus can reach the targets for scraping, these show a green Up icon. If something has gone wrong, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a red Down icon. So, this view is good for troubleshooting, to discover if Prometheus is able to reach the node exporter services running on the machines you want to monitor.\nGrafana Configuration # There\u0026rsquo;s also a datasource.yml in the grafana folder. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to make any edits as it just specifies that Prometheus will be a data source and where to reach it on the network. Since these two containers are in the same Compose deployment, Grafana can reach Prometheus by Docker DNS at the name prometheus and on its default port of 9090.\nStarting the Services # That concludes the initial config file changes that we need to do. At this point we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start up the containers and connect to our new services. Just make a note of whichever is present on your system and substitute the right form in the commands below if needed. To start the deployment run this:\ndocker compose up -d The -d flag here instructs Docker to run the deployment in the background and not print all the logs directly to the screen.\nIf you see any errors, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that there\u0026rsquo;s a mistake in your compose.yaml file or in one of the configuration files. In that case I\u0026rsquo;d suggest to go back and look for any errors or deviations from what I showed above.\nInfluxDB 2 Setup # With InfluxDB there is no manual configuration required. However, we will need to setup our credentials to create buckets later on. Open your browser and navigate to your IP address followed by the port 8086. Fill in everything. In our example, I am setting up the initial bucket as \u0026lsquo;influxdb\u0026rsquo; as the software will have some of its own data to store.\nOnce you hit continue there will be a secret key. Make sure you save this as we will use it later. Alternatively, we can create API keys in the dashboard in the future.\nInfluxDB is a very powerful tool with a ton of features. I highly recommend you read up on the documentation and learn a little about it. It\u0026rsquo;s designed so well that if you just wanted a database platform with simple graphs this could be a great stand-alone option for you. Below is a screenshot of Proxmox data that we will import later in this guide.\nGrafana Setup # With the containers up, we can now go and connect to Grafana and set up our dashboard. By default, Grafana will be exposed on port 3000 on the machine running Docker. Go ahead and type the IP/port or host/port combo into your browser, and then log into Grafana with the admin/admin for the username and password. It will then prompt you to change it.\nFirst, here in the Grafana interface, let\u0026rsquo;s go to the Connections section and select Data sources. This is where we manage and add all the sources that Grafana will use to display data.\nPrometheus\nBy default, we should see our Prometheus data source here, which was added according to the Grafana config file. If we open up the Prometheus data source and scroll down a bit, we can see the scrape interval configuration. As I mentioned earlier, if you changed your scrape interval in the Prometheus configuration, you should also change it here so they are the same. Otherwise you can run into issues where the data does not display properly on the graphs.\nScrolling down a bit more, we can see the Save \u0026amp; test button, which also provides a helpful way to confirm that Grafana can reach Prometheus to grab data. Now speaking of diagnostics, let\u0026rsquo;s go take a look in the Prometheus web interface to see how we can check the status of Prometheus scrape jobs.\nInfluxDB 2\nThe InfluxDB source won\u0026rsquo;t be loaded in there automatically like our Prometheus data source was. We will need to add this manually. Under \u0026lsquo;Connections\u0026rsquo; in the left navigation pane click on \u0026lsquo;Add new connection\u0026rsquo;, then type \u0026ldquo;InfluxDB\u0026rdquo; within the search bar. Click on the result to setup the connection. Name this what you\u0026rsquo;d like, and for my setup I will be using InfluxQL as the language. Flux is another good option, but it is in beta and many of the popular dashboards will not work with Flux.\nSince all 3 of these services are in the same Docker compose file we can use the Docker DNS hostname in the URL section sending in the port 8086. My initial setup is an unecryped HTTP connection so the only Auth option I\u0026rsquo;ll have selected is \u0026lsquo;Skip TLS Verify\u0026rsquo;.\nFor the InfluxDB Details, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be starting with my Proxmox bucket. For Database I added the name of the initial bucket we created earlier. My username and the password is the key we saved earlier from the InfluxDB setup. When you click save and test you should get a message similar to the one below.\nOptional Hosts Config # While you can use IP addresses for any machines that you want to monitor, it is again helpful to use names instead. If you already have some kind of internal DNS setup for your network, you can use those names. If not, you can also add entries to the hosts file at /etc/hosts.\nsudo nano /etc/hosts Below the default hostnames, I added some for local servers that I would like to use names for. To do this you simply add a new line with the local IP address followed by the name you\u0026rsquo;d like to use. You can also use additional local domains and extra names as shown in the unRAID example. A system reboot will be required to change host names.\n# System Default 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 dockerlab # Custom Hostnames 10.0.0.65 Nextcloud 10.0.0.90 unRAID unraid.local 10.0.0.218 proxmox Now inside the Prometheus configuration, you can use that name. Here\u0026rsquo;s an expanded example showing three targets for the node exporter including the new hostnames we just added:\n- job_name: node_exporter static_configs: - targets: - dockerlab:9100 - Nextcloud:9100 - unRAID:9100 You can add as many machines as you want like this on new lines. Note that anytime you add another machine to the config you will need to restart the Prometheus container. The simplest way to do that in this case will be to restart the entire Docker Compose deployment, which is done in the directory with the compose file using the command below.\ndocker compose restart Docker Compose Tips\nAlso, here are a couple quick tips for managing this deployment with Docker compose. If you ever want to bring the deployment down for any reason, use the down command.If you are having issue and want to view the logs from both the Grafana and Prometheus containers, run the logs command.\ndocker compose down docker compose logs Node Exporter Dashboard # Now let\u0026rsquo;s set up the node exporter dashboard in Grafana. The good news is that there\u0026rsquo;s an excellent premade dashboard available as a community submission to the Grafana library. That\u0026rsquo;s actually true for many common use cases, as we\u0026rsquo;ll see below. Building custom Grafana dashboards isn\u0026rsquo;t something we\u0026rsquo;ll cover in this guide, but it is totally possible.\nThe Grafana interface has a few sections in the left side bar menu. Select Dashboards and hit the Create Dashboard button to create a new dashboard.\nIn this case we are importing a dashboard, so press Import dashboard. The dashboard we\u0026rsquo;ll be importing is called Node Exporter Full. Grafana hosts a library of dashboards that different people have shared, and Node Exporter Full is on this link. To import the dashboard, enter the dashboard\u0026rsquo;s number, 1860, or past the URL into the appropriate box and hit Load.\nName your dahbaord whatever you\u0026rsquo;d like and click the dropdown at the bottom that says Select a Prometheus data source and select the default Prometheus. Then hit the import button to complete the import process.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be taken directly to the dashboard, and it will be available to select later from the main dashboards page. If you already started up the node exporter service on one machine and everything is working properly, you should already see that machine in the Host dropdown.\nThe gauges at the top should already be showing readings too. It will take a while though before you collect enough data for the charts below to be interesting.\nAlright, so that\u0026rsquo;s the basic setup. If you have multiple machines configured you can select them from the Host dropdown. By default Grafana displays the last 24 hours of data, but you can change that by clicking on the date and time selector in the upper right.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a few convenient shortcuts, and you can also select precise date and time ranges using the fields on the left side. Click the calendar icons to select dates from a visual calendar, then hit the Apply time range button to see just that data in the charts. You can also click and drag on any chart to zoom in on a specific time period.\nBeside the time range selector there is also a widget to set the auto refresh rate, as well as a button to refresh immediately. If you scroll down, you\u0026rsquo;ll see more sections that can be expanded with graphs of different data. That pretty much sums it up for the important controls here on the dashboard page, but of course there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to Grafana for you to explore if you want, such as building custom dashboards.\nunRAID and Prometheus Node Exporter # In the Optional Hosts Config section above you can see that I added my unRAID server to both my hosts file as well as the Prometheus configuration under the node_exporter job. Yet, we have not installed the node exporter on unRAID. Doing this is a very straight forward process.\nHead over to the application page and search for \u0026lsquo;prometheus node exporter\u0026rsquo; and install the plugin as show in the image below.\nOnce this is installed data will be available for Prometheus to collect. You may need to restart your containers to begin pulling data. Now in your existing Node Exporter dashboard you will see the new unRAID option under the hosts selection.\nProxmox and InfluxDB Setup # Proxmox is one of the main platforms running on my home lab so gathering metrics and viewing them easily is critical. Thankfully, Proxmox has a build in exporter for InfluxDB. Above when we setup our web UI for InfluxDB we created an initial bucket for Proxmox. If you created a bucket for a different data set, now is a good time to make a bucket specifically for Proxmox.\nOnce you have a bucket ready for Proxmox we can begin exporting metrics. To do this login to your Proxmox dashboard and click on \u0026lsquo;Datacenter\u0026rsquo; in the top left. In the Datacenter menu scroll down until you find the \u0026lsquo;Metrics Server\u0026rsquo; setting pane. When you click add there will be two different options. For our setup pick InfluxDB. Check the image below to see how I filled it out with my information. Server will be the IP of the machine InfluxDB is running on.\nBe sure to use the token that was generated when setting up InfluxDB. If needed you can create new API keys within the InfluxDB web UI. Click on create and within a few minutes you will start to see data populate within your bucket. Now, we can use the connection we added eariler in Grafana with our Proxmox data to visualize the data. Follow the steps we used eariler to import a dashboard, but this time we will import the one labeled as Proxmox (10048) my personal favorite dashboard for Proxmox. Select the InfluxDB you created earlier as the data source and import. Once in select all your storage and interfaces, make any edits you need and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go!\nMonitor Docker with Telegraf # For my setup I\u0026rsquo;m using Telegraf as a container to monitor Docker on this host system and any other systems with Docker containers. I will note, I\u0026rsquo;m not necessarily using best practices for this in terms of security. This container is running as privileged with access to the root file system of the machine. If you\u0026rsquo;d prefer you can remove this service from the docker compose file and come up with your own implementation.\nFirst, create a new bucket specifically for docker on our host system. Later will will do this with a seperate machine running Unraid and link it to InfluxDB on our dockerlab machine. After you create a bucket for Docker head over to your Telegraf config in your project directory.\nnano telegraf/telegraf.conf You can see in my default configuration is setup only to monitor docker with some system monitoring plugins commented out. I recommend you read up on their documentation for plugin specific configuration. To monitor docker with the included configuration you\u0026rsquo;ll only need to change the information under the outputs plugin to match your setup. You shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to change the URL since it\u0026rsquo;s running in the same stack.\n[[outputs.influxdb_v2]] urls = [\u0026#34;http://influxdb:8086\u0026#34;] token = \u0026#34;yourtoken\u0026#34; organization = \u0026#34;yourorg\u0026#34; bucket = \u0026#34;localbucket\u0026#34; After you save your configuration restart docker compose and head over to your InfluxDB dashboard to see if it is gathering data from Telegraf. It may take a few for data to populate and you may need to log in and out of this dashboard. If everything is looking good we can import another dashboard in Grafana to monitor Docker!\nSince our InfluxDB Proxmox data is using InfluxQL we are going to want to create a new connection to the same InfluxDB instance, but this time using Flux. Our Docker dashboard supports Flux and this will allow use to visualize multiple buckets within a single dashboard. Similar to have having multiple instances of the Node Exporter in your configuration will show up. Change the name to something identifiable. I usually just match the bucket name.\nAfter you add the data source we will be importing the Docker Monitoring (18389) and selecting the new data we setup with Flux. Once the dashboard is imported select the bucket download and pick the bucket that has your Docker data!\nMonitor Unraid with Telegraf # The whole reason I decided to fight with Telegraf to begin with is to get a very specific Unraid dashboard. Actually getting Unriad to work with Telegraf proved to be a very difficult endeavour. But, I got everything working! This article is already way to long so I outlined all the steps it took within the compainion Github repo for this article.\nserver-monitoring/unraid at main · TechHutTV/server-monitoring # Docker compose featuring Grafana, Prometheus, and Influxdb2 - TechHutTV/server-monitoring\nWas it all worth it?

While the set up is relatively straightforward, these are in fact industrial grade tools with a variety of use cases beyond what we covered today.\nI hope that this setup will serve you well in understanding what\u0026rsquo;s happening with the machines in your lab, and that you\u0026rsquo;re feeling inspired to experiment and learn more about the world of monitoring and alerts.

You heard me right: if you update to 6.1, you will not get \u0026ldquo;Reef\u0026rdquo;, the wallpaper you can see in the screenshot above. Instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the same wallpaper that 6.0 had, and it\u0026rsquo;s my fault.\nLet me explain that. Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been the person who mostly handled anything related to KDE wallpapers: organizing competitions, updating the images in the repositories, and more. This time around we decided to ask the previous artist to produce a new wallpaper. This took a bit of time, and the Visual Design group had feedback on that, multiple versions were made, and all of that took time. We only agreed on the final version the week before release. Due to personal reasons, I was not able to run the scripts until a few days later; by then, it was simply too late. I missed the packaging deadline for Plasma 6.1. Luckily, you can still download the wallpaper here if you like it!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get to the main feature. Here\u0026rsquo;s the completely new look for Plasma\u0026rsquo;s Edit Mode:\nAs you can see, the screen will become a bit smaller; if you open any settings window (such as the widgets sidebar, or the panel settings) the desktop will move aside to make sure nothing is being covered. Not only does this look better, but it solves a variety of bug reports where the panel edit mode window would accidentally hide the top toolbar or even other panels. The experience is much, much nicer.\nAnd 6.2 will bring more improvements, too! Me and Marco are currently working on a complete refactor of drag-and-drop for applets in Edit Mode. Previously it was impossible to move an applet from one panel to another, or even to anywhere on the desktop. We\u0026rsquo;re making sure to add support for that.\nPlasma 6.1 # Plasma 6.1 brings improvements and powerful new features to every part of your desktop\nOther features of 6.1: you can now set up remote desktops within System Settings, something that will make sysadmins\u0026rsquo; lives much easier.

Nix has been trending lately so there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of it. But if you went to do some research about Nix you might have gotten a bit lost in concepts like dependency trees and the Nix programming language.\nThe good news is that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to understand how Nix works in depth or know any programming to enjoy the benefits that it brings. Nix has a repo of about 80,000 packages, which puts it up there with the Arch Linux AUR as a contender for the largest in the Linux ecosystem. You can actually use Nix on top of any distro and even MacOS, but today we\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing on NixOS specifically. First, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a bit about what makes Nix special, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate a basic server installation to show how it works in practice.\nhttps://youtu.be/GymWdyizBRA\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Great About NixOS? # Aside from a large amount of available software, NixOS provides a unique approach to system administration that comes with some solid advantages. Every NixOS installation is built from a configuration.nix file in such a way that the same configuration always results in the same system. Said differently, NixOS is an immutable operating system. It\u0026rsquo;s not the only one though, there\u0026rsquo;s also Fedora Silverblue and GNU\u0026rsquo;s Guix which includes a package manager similar to Nix.\nSo in practice, updating a NixOS system or installing packages is done by editing configuration.nix and rebuilding the system. If something goes wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to roll back to a previous working configuration. That\u0026rsquo;s similar in a way to snapshot systems like Timeshift, with the difference that Nix stores the recipe needed to build the system as it was at that point in time rather than just a copy of a given filesystem state.\nThe configuration based approach to system administration also means that it\u0026rsquo;s easy to replicate a given system. All that\u0026rsquo;s needed is to copy and apply the configuration into the new environment. This is rather different than the traditional approach where systems are set up using a combination of shell commands and editing config files. If you ever tried to duplicate a Linux environment from one server or VM to another, you might understand part of the problem that NixOS solves.\nUnless you have a photographic memory for every shell command and configuration edit, probably you\u0026rsquo;ve ended up in the situation where a fresh install didn\u0026rsquo;t quite work because of some forgotten apt install command or config file edit. With NixOS all you have to do is keep a copy of your configuration.nix safe, and all the package installs and config edits are handled automatically when building the system.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s jump in and see how that works in practice when setting up a fresh NixOS system.\nInstalling NixOS # If you want to try NixOS, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to first download one of the ISO images. Just head over to the download page at nixos.org, scroll down to NixOS : the Linux distribution, and grab either the graphical or minimal ISO image.\nYou can use the graphical ISO and graphical installer to do a minimal server style install too. If you prefer to install from the CLI, grab the minimal image. The NixOS documentation includes complete instructions for how to do a CLI install, and to be honest it isn\u0026rsquo;t bad. If you ever tried installing Arch manually, you\u0026rsquo;ll find Nix to be quite a bit simpler.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;ll show the process of using the graphical installer to do a minimal install into a VM that would be suitable as a server. If you are interested in testing NixOS on a single board computer like a Raspberry Pi, the support for ARM is apparently pretty good, according to the folks on Reddit, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t test that yet. In any case, for installing to a physical machine, go ahead and burn the ISO to a USB stick and boot from it.\nInstall Steps # When you boot up the NixOS graphical ISO it will launch the installer automatically. The first steps are pretty standard stuff. It will ask you about your language, timezone, keyboard layout, and preferred user name. The installer is a bit strict about requiring strong passwords for your user account and the root password, which is kind of annoying if you only plan to connect to the machine using SSH keys or via secure tunnels.\nNext is the choice of desktop environment. There are about ten to choose from which is a nice range of options, but in this case I\u0026rsquo;m choosing \u0026ldquo;no desktop\u0026rdquo; as this will only be for server use.\nAfter that there\u0026rsquo;s a choice about whether or not to include unfree software. Just to be clear, that\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; as in \u0026ldquo;free speech\u0026rdquo;, so this is just asking if you want to allow any non open source software to be installed on your system. That can include hardware drivers where no open source option exists, so there can be issues with hardware support if these packages aren\u0026rsquo;t allowed.\nFinally there are a couple of options for partitioning disks as setting up the bootloader. If you have a full disk to dedicate to the install, just select it and use the erase option to start fresh. Otherwise you can partition the disk manually. Of course if you want more control, installing manually in a terminal is the way to go.\nYou can double check the summary to make sure everything looks alright, then start the install and kick back. Once it\u0026rsquo;s completed, you can now reboot into your fresh NixOS environment.\nAfter boot setup # On the first login, we\u0026rsquo;re in a shell with some nice green and black hacker vibes. Let\u0026rsquo;s first get our system set up with SSH.\nTo activate services or install packages, we\u0026rsquo;ll edit our configuration.nix file. This requires root, so using nano that would be:\nsudo nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix Inside we find the configuration file that the installer has created for us. Basically, all the info we provided to the installer is here, and we can see that it\u0026rsquo;s also referencing the results of a hardware scan that are stored in a separate file.\nScrolling down the file a bit, we\u0026rsquo;ll also see some suggestions that are commented out, including for activating SSH.\n# List services that you want to enable: # Enable the OpenSSH daemon. # CUSTOMIZED services.openssh.enable = true; # Open ports in the firewall. # networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ ... ]; # networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [ ... ]; I\u0026rsquo;ve just deleted the # symbol at the beginning of the line to indicate that SSH should be active. Above there\u0026rsquo;s also a list of installed packages. I\u0026rsquo;ve also uncommented vim here so that I can use it rather than nano to edit this file in the future. One important note here is that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to include SSH in the list of packages. Nix will automatically make sure that the package is present when we enable the service.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;ll save and close the file with ctrl-o, enter to write the file and ctrl-x to exit. So far nothing has actually changed on the system though. To do that, we need to rebuild. The standard command looks like this:\nsudo nixos-rebuild switch This builds everything we need for our new system, including downloading any new software packages, and switches us immediately into the new environment. It will also set the new configuration as the default when we boot the system up again. Let\u0026rsquo;s try that now.\nIt looks like everything went well and the sshd service has been started. And indeed, I can connect over SSH and enjoy managing my new server OS with all the amenities of my daily driver terminal.\nKey Based SSH Auth # Personally, I like to use key based authentication for SSH exclusively and not allow any password based remote logins. To add an authorized public SSH key to a user in NixOS, edit the configuration.nix file again. This time look for the user account section and insert a block like shown here:\nTo also disable password based logins, add a line like this one:\nOne unavoidable quirk of working with NixOS is that all of this configuration is done in the Nix programming language. Even if you have background in programming, it can still take some getting used to. The good news is that in the end most things that you will want to do are basically the same story as in other config file formats: copy and paste and fill in your own values as needed.\nResources for NixOS Config # There are various resources for finding configuration.nix snippets to add whatever you might need to your system.\nnixos.org/manual/nixos\nnixos.wiki\nsearch the web (look for Reddit and NixOS forum posts)\nIf all else fails and you aren\u0026rsquo;t faint of heart, there is essentially an exhaustive list of options available at mynixos.com. These are derived from the source code that defines the options, and they typically come with a default or example to reference.\nSet Up Docker # So far we didn\u0026rsquo;t rebuild our system yet to add the SSH key to my user account and disable password based SSH logins. Before doing that, let\u0026rsquo;s also add Docker.\nAs an example of what I was just saying, searching for Docker on nixos.wiki leads to this rather helpful page, and we can basically just copy and paste what we need from there.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the one line to enable Docker:\nvirtualisation.docker.enable = true; This can go anywhere in the configuration.nix file. Also, I recommend checking out the Docker page on the Wiki, this goes into detail on adding your user to the docker group and enabling rootless commands. Placing it together with the lines I added earlier for SSH feels good for now:\nPer the wiki page, I\u0026rsquo;ll also add myself to the `docker` user group by adding an entry to my groups list:\nWith that, let\u0026rsquo;s do a nixos-rebuild switch and see what happens:\nsudo nixos-rebuild switch Nix will install all the necessary packages and start up the Docker daemon. After that, I\u0026rsquo;ll also need to log in again so that the fact that my user is in the `docker` group takes effect. To do that I just disconnected and reconnected by SSH, and now I can use Docker:\nFirewall # Depending on the type of container you\u0026rsquo;re running in Docker you may need to open some ports in the firewall. Below is an example from the Wiki on enabling standard web ports and opening ranges of ports.\nnetworking.firewall = { enable = true; allowedTCPPorts = [ 80 443 ]; allowedUDPPortRanges = [ { from = 4000; to = 4007; } { from = 8000; to = 8010; } ]; }; For the example in the video above I only needed to open the 9443 port for Portainer and the 9090 port for Cockpit. Like everything else checkout the Firewall Wiki page for everything you need to know.\nConclusion # NixOS is a rather interesting development in the world of Linux distributions. While immutable operating systems are not exactly a new thing\u0026ndash;mobile devices and gaming consoles have worked this way for a quite a while\u0026ndash;they are by far not the norm either in home labs or commercial deployments.\nGetting started with NixOS turns out to be rather simple, and it provides a really nice experience for setting up server and VM instances like I showed here. With just a few lines of config, we got a core system running with SSH, Docker, and remote access via Twingate. And by keeping a copy of that configuration.nix file, we can spin up an identical machine with just a couple commands in a fresh NixOS install.\nThere are some caveats though to working with NixOS, and they may or may not bother you depending on your use case. For our Docker host example, everything will work more or less identically to a more mainstream distro. However the way that Nix handles packages can come with some surprises for certain use cases. For example, installing Python packages that don\u0026rsquo;t already exist as a Nix package can be notoriously difficult. That\u0026rsquo;s never going to be an issue when running deployments in Docker though.\nCertainly Ubuntu isn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere anytime soon as the server OS of choice across the planet, but with next generation immutable options like NixOS gaining popularity, we may be in the midst of a shift toward a new and better style of operating system for servers.\n","date":"June 13, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/nixos-best-server-os-setup/","section":"2024s","summary":"","title":"NixOS - The New Best Server OS?","type":"2024"},{"content":" The Nix Governance Crisis # Nix is a declarative package manager, builds packages in isolation from each other, and strongly focuses on reliability (as in, \u0026ldquo;one package cannot break other packages\u0026rdquo;). The project is currently undergoing a governance crisis that resulted in the resignation of the head of the NixOS Foundation (Eelco Dolstra) and even a fork supported by some of the biggest Nix contributors.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s quickly introduce the actors involved in the crisis. We have the NixOS Foundation, representing the Nix community on legal matters, led (until recently) by Eelco Dolstra – the main author of Nix. Dolstra also leads a for-profit company called Determinate Systems, offering paid support on Nix-related matters to private companies.\nA Moderation Team has also been instituted within the Nix project, though it is quite limited in scope compared to its initial introduction proposal: it can merely monitor official spaces and ban people obviously acting out of ill intent and has no authority over community teams and developers.\nEven though Dolstra does not officially have a privileged role within the Nix developers community, many members have accused him of implicit authority and soft power, abusing his role to push his decisions and block others\u0026rsquo;. He has also reportedly acted dismissive towards any criticism towards him or the Foundation, which has led many to burn out.\nOne of the main examples of this behavior is the Anduril incident. Anduril is a military tech company, a US defense sector contractor that produces war drones and cameras for the US-Mexico border. They seem to use Nix internally and have contributed to the project throughout the years. They wanted to sponsor the 2023 Nix Conference, but the community did not want Nix to be associated with Anduril, the video operation centre threatened to pull off at the last minute (effectively preventing the event from happening), and the sponsorship was dropped. However, Anduril was yet again selected as a sponsor for the 2024 NixCon; an open letter was published asking for the sponsorship to be retracted, but Dolstra quickly brushed off the criticism without acting on it. Anduril is likely a paying customer of Dolstra\u0026rsquo;s company, Determinate Systems, which would result in a significant conflict of interest.\nAnother open letter (\u0026ldquo;Eelco Dolstra\u0026rsquo;s leadership is corrosive to the Nix project\u0026rdquo;) was crafted and driven forward by many Moderation team members. Much controversy ensued, and third open letter appeared (\u0026ldquo;Memorandum on Equitable Moderation\u0026rdquo;) effectively accusing the Moderation team of attempting a hostile takeover of the project. Here the whole crisis got quite political since the Moderation team was accused of using the \u0026ldquo;myth of marginalization\u0026rdquo; to censor Nix developers – though, the evidence of this is quite unconvincing. The authors of this Memorandum, and other Nix developers who aggressively attacked the Moderation team and its policies, were eventually banned from the community.\nOn the 30th of April, Dolstra announced he would be stepping down from the board of the NixOS Foundation; a \u0026ldquo;constitutional assembly\u0026rdquo; was announced to institute a community-based governance of the project. This Assembly would also be tasked with defining sponsorship policies (e.g. whether to accept Anduril sponsorship) and policies against discrimination towards minorities.\nJust a couple of days a fork of Nix was announced. It\u0026rsquo;s called Lix and it\u0026rsquo;s been in the works since early February; it\u0026rsquo;s handled by \u0026ldquo;a team of 10+ people\u0026rdquo; and represents \u0026ldquo;an independent organization that takes its responsibility to its community seriously\u0026rdquo;. Its main points include being \u0026ldquo;built for a community, not for a corporation\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;a safe community for developers of all backgrounds\u0026rdquo; and more. There\u0026rsquo;s no explicit reference to Nix, but the subtext is quite clear.\nThis story is still developing and I\u0026rsquo;ll be following it in the coming weeks too.\nhttps://github.com/KFearsoff/nix-drama-explained?tab=readme-ov-file\u0026amp;ref=techhut.tv\nValve publishes Proton 9.0 # Valve has just published another major update to Proton, the compatibility layer that allows to run Windows-based games on Linux. It\u0026rsquo;s a lovely tool that allowed the SteamDeck to be Linux-based and helped out significantly to run any type of game on our favorite operating system. I\u0026rsquo;ll quote the Linuxiac regarding the now-playable games:\nTitles that were previously only playable using the experimental version of Proton, such as Sonic Colors: Ultimate, The Finals, and Lord of the Rings: Gollum, are now fully supported.\nYou can find more information here:\nhttps://linuxiac.com/proton-9-0-rolls-out-with-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux/?ref=techhut.tv\nLXQt publishes version 2.0.0 # This week we also got a new major release of the LXQt project; the main new feature is the support for Qt6, as the desktop now relies on version 6.6 of the graphical toolkit. Other changes include much better Wayland support (for compositors such as LabWC, Wayfire, kwin_wayland, Hyprland, and Sway); layer-shell-qt6 compatibility (a new spec that allows defining some shell components such as panels); a new default application menu called Fancy Menu (which includes \u0026ldquo;Favorites\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;All Applications\u0026rdquo;, and better search).

Bluesky is quite similar to Mastodon, and its main advantage over it is that it makes switching between servers much easier (though, there aren\u0026rsquo;t nearly as many to switch between).\nWell, Dorsey has just announced he\u0026rsquo;s no longer on Bluesky\u0026rsquo;s Board of Directors and he endorsed Twitter instead, calling it \u0026ldquo;freedom technology\u0026rdquo;. Though it is debatable whether Bluesky or Mastodon \u0026ldquo;is better\u0026rdquo;, we can certainly say that either platform is miles ahead of Twitter in terms of transparency and decentralizing. It will be interesting to see how Bluesky will evolve from now on.\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2024/5/5/24149543/jack-dorsey-gone-bluesky-board?ref=techhut.tv\n","date":"May 28, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2024/05/nix-governance-crisis-and-more/","section":"2024s","summary":"","title":"Nix governance Crisis and MORE!","type":"2024"},{"content":"This is my first look at the upcoming Linux desktop developed by System76.

Initially, I reacted with shock and horror, but upon further thought, I realized it’s a valid query worth exploring. Yes, you can use Windows for this purpose, and I\u0026rsquo;ll guide you through the process.\nhttps://youtu.be/5pZu35hTipo\nIntroduction # While there are superior NAS-specific operating systems like UNRAID, TrueNAS, and Open Media Vault, Windows can still provide NAS functionality for those who prefer it or are simply working with an existing Windows installation. This guide will show you how to transform a Windows desktop into a NAS.\nPrerequisites # A PC or NAS Unit: If using a NAS make sure it is compatible with 3rd party operating systems.\nA USB Drive (at least 8GB): You\u0026rsquo;ll need this to install Windows.\nEthernet Connection: For downloading necessary tools and updates. Ethernet is highly recommended, but Wifi will work.\nSteps to Set Up Windows as a NAS # 1. Preparing the Installation Media # Download Windows 11:\nVisit the Windows 11 download page.\nScroll down and click \u0026ldquo;Download Now\u0026rdquo; for the Windows 11 installation media.\nSelect your language and click \u0026ldquo;Confirm\u0026rdquo; to start the download.\nDownload and Install Rufus:\nGo to the Rufus website and download the latest version.\nRufus helps create bootable USB drives with additional customization options.\nCreate a Bootable USB Drive:\nOpen Rufus and plug in your USB drive.\nSelect the downloaded Windows 11 ISO file.\nChoose the default settings or customize as needed. For simplicity, name the drive (e.g., \u0026ldquo;WinUSB\u0026rdquo;).\nBelow is a screenshot with the recommended option. The main option that makes the process easier is to create a simple username with no spaces.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo; and wait for the process to complete.\n2. Installing Windows on a Home Server # https://youtu.be/lTlGJC6irNQ\nBoot from USB:\nPlug the USB into your NAS device and boot into the BIOS (usually by pressing Delete, F1, F12, or Esc during startup).\nSet the USB drive as the primary boot device and save changes.\nWindows Installation:\nFollow the on-screen instructions to install Windows.\nWhen prompted to select an installation location, choose the NVME or SSD boot drive. Do note that this will delete any data on the drive.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)\u0026rdquo; to manually configure partitions.\nIf necessary, delete existing partitions on the NVME drive to start with a clean slate. Select each partition of the proper drive and click \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter deleting partitions, select the unallocated space and click \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; to allow Windows to create the necessary partitions automatically.\nProceed with the installation.\nInitial Setup:\nAfter installation, if you didn\u0026rsquo;t step the user in Rufus, go through the basic setup, creating a local account (preferably without spaces, e.g., \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo;).\nUpdate display drivers and other essential drivers through Windows Update.\n3.

BIOS Configuration # During the reboot process, now is a good time to make sure our BIOS setting won\u0026rsquo;t interfere with anything we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do.\nEnabling Wake on LAN:\nLocate the Wake on LAN setting in the BIOS menu.\nEnable Wake on LAN for network cards to allow the system to wake up remotely.\nOptional Settings:\nOptionally, enable S5 via RTC if you want the NAS to start up automatically at a specific time.\nDisable Fast Boot if using Wake on LAN, as Fast Boot may interfere with Wake on LAN functionality.\n5. Accessing Your NAS # Checking Wake-up Status: Connect to the network tab on another machine to check if the NAS responds and wakes up as expected.\nVerify that the NAS wakes up and is accessible on the network.\n6. Create a Storage Pool # https://youtu.be/Ipnnt6f7d4I\nWorking with Windows Storage Spaces\nPress Windows + S to open the search bar, then type \u0026ldquo;Manage Storage Spaces\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Manage Storage Spaces\u0026rdquo; from the results.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; if prompted by User Account Control (UAC).\nIn the Storage Spaces window, click on \u0026ldquo;Create a new pool and storage space.\u0026rdquo;\nSelect the drives you want to include in the storage pool by checking the boxes next to them.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Create pool.\u0026rdquo;\nEnter a name for your storage pool in the provided field.\nChoose a drive letter or mount point for the pool.\nSelect a resiliency type for your storage space:\nSimple: Provides no data redundancy. Data is stored across the selected drives without duplication. This offers the highest storage capacity but offers no protection against drive failure.\nMirror: Stores two copies of your data across the drives. This provides better protection against drive failure, as your data remains accessible even if one drive fails. However, it requires at least two drives.\nParity: Similar to RAID 5, Parity stores data along with parity information across the drives. This allows for data recovery in case of a single drive failure. However, it requires at least three drives and can have a performance impact during write operations.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Create storage space\u0026rdquo; to create the storage pool.\nFixing Common Errors: Physical Disk Sector Size\nOpen the Disk Management tool by pressing Windows + X and selecting \u0026ldquo;Disk Management\u0026rdquo; from the menu.\nLocate the disk(s) you intend to include in the storage pool. Right-click on each disk and select \u0026ldquo;Properties.\u0026rdquo;\nGo to the \u0026ldquo;Volumes\u0026rdquo; tab and click on \u0026ldquo;Format.\u0026rdquo; Follow the on-screen instructions to format the disk with a sector size of 4096 bytes.\nRepeat this process for all disks that will be part of the storage pool.\nAfter formatting the disks with the correct sector size, attempt to create the storage pool again following the previous instructions.\n7. Setting Up Network Shares # https://youtu.be/1yrChg7XW-A\nCreate Shared Folders:\nCreate your shared folders in the new storage pool that we created. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing this on a system without a storage pool any folder that you create on your system can be shared.\nRight-click the desired folder \u0026gt; Properties \u0026gt; Sharing tab.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Share\u0026rdquo; and select users or groups to share with.\nSet permissions as needed.\nAccess Shares from Other Devices:\nUse the network path (e.g., \\\\WinNAS\\sharedfolder) to access the shared folders from other computers on the network. Layout is Important\nGenerally, I create a data folder that stores most everything (e.g., movies, books, downloads) so that future application have easy access to move data within a single share.\nIf you plan on using docker, creating a share for the configurations is a good practice.\n8. Remote Desktop Configuration # Enabling Remote Desktop:\nNavigate to the system settings to enable Remote Desktop access on the NAS.\nConfigure Remote Desktop settings, including user permissions and connection preferences.\nConnecting via Remote Desktop Connection:\nUse Remote Desktop Connection to connect to the NAS from a remote device or computer.\nEnter the NAS\u0026rsquo;s IP address or hostname along with the appropriate credentials to establish a remote desktop session.\n9. Enable OpenSSH Server for SSH/SFTP # https://youtu.be/9kQ75FxxkUw\nEnable OpenSSH Server and Authenticat****ion\nOpen the \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; app by pressing Windows key + I.\nGo to \u0026ldquo;Apps\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Optional Features\u0026rdquo;.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Add a feature\u0026rdquo;.\nScroll down or search for \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH Client\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH Server\u0026rdquo;\nClick on the feature and select \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo;.\nEnable the Services:\nPress Windows + S to open the search bar, then type \u0026ldquo;Services\u0026rdquo; then click on the first result.\nIn the Services window, scroll down or use the search bar to locate the service you want to enable. These will be \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH SSH Server (sshd)\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH Authentication Agent (ssh-agent)\u0026rdquo;.\nRight-click on the service and select \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the Properties window, under the \u0026ldquo;General\u0026rdquo; tab, find the \u0026ldquo;Startup type\u0026rdquo; dropdown menu.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Automatic\u0026rdquo; from the dropdown menu to ensure that the service starts automatically when you boot your computer.\nFrom this same panel you can click \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo; to start the service then click \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; to save the changes.\n10.

Accessing Services Remotely (Twingate) # Several methods exist for remote connectivity, including setting up a reverse proxy, using a virtual private network (VPN), or employing zero-trust services. Reverse proxies like Nginx or Apache allow users to securely access web applications by routing traffic through a single entry point. VPNs create encrypted connections between remote devices and the home network, ensuring data privacy and security.

As in, you can both talk to your phone and have your video feed on - as if you were in a video call - and the model will talk back to you with minimal latency using the video as additional information. Words don\u0026rsquo;t do this justice, so I would recommend watching the videos on the below-linked webpage.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also incredibly fast, and 50% cheaper in the API compared to GPT-4 Turbo. The audio delay is 320 milliseconds on average, which is close to human speed. Previously, voice interaction was just the standard text-based GPT but with transcribe + voice synthesizer models. This meant a complete lack of the ability to gather tone, handle multiple speakers, or express emotions. GPT-4o instead uses a single end-to-end model across text, vision, and audio. It\u0026rsquo;s seriously impressive.\nEveryone can try out ChatGPT-4o right away, it\u0026rsquo;s free (but up to a limited amount of messages).

Even though many organizations have defined themselves to be working on \u0026ldquo;Open Source AI\u0026rdquo;, there\u0026rsquo;s actually no agreed-upon definition for that term. And, maybe, we need one?\nThe latest draft, from the 24th of April, requires the following. We need detailed information about the data used to train the system, how it was obtained and selected, and all about the labeling procedures. The source code used to train and run the system has to be fully open source, including tokenizers, inference, and the model architecture. Finally, the model parameters have to be available too.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to notice that OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s work is extremely opaque and it would not even get close to being classified as \u0026ldquo;Open Source\u0026rdquo;, under any definition.\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2024/05/16/open_source_initiative_ai/?ref=techhut.tv\nMicrosoft announces ARM laptops from six different manufacturers # And they\u0026rsquo;ve chosen the worst possible branding for it!\nMicrosoft is now trying to compete with Apple\u0026rsquo;s (great) M-chips by using custom Qualcomm Snapdragon X ARM chips. Even though they\u0026rsquo;ve tried this road in the past with little luck, they now claim that they have improvements to the hardware and software that will make these devices competitive with Apple\u0026rsquo;s line on both performance and battery life.

Copilot + PC.\nAnyway. As mentioned, the hardware improvements are mostly about this new Snapdragon X Elite chip, whereas on the software side, there\u0026rsquo;s an improved emulator called Prism. According to Microsoft, Prism is as efficient as Apple Rosetta 2. Also, most applications - Photoshop, Dropbox, Zoom, Spotify … - have been ported to ARM already, another improvement since the first Microsoft ARM laptop introduction.\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24160463/microsoft-windows-laptops-copilot-arm-chips-m1?ref=techhut.tv\nOpen Source is neither a community nor a democracy # This is an article by David Heinemeier Hansson.

All the core applications have also been upgraded to the latest version.\nAnd then, finally, there are the \u0026ldquo;under-the-hood\u0026rdquo; changes.

Here\u0026rsquo;s another round of improvements to the current pre-alpha.\nFirstly, theming support has been added to GTK applications and apps packaged through flatpaks (which are within a container and thus need extra support to follow the system theme). You can also choose not to apply a global theme and let the apps style themselves. You can also switch between dark and light mode depending on the time of day, which is a feature that comes out-of-the-box almost nowhere else.\nCOSMIC is also building its own App Store. So far it\u0026rsquo;s fairly simple (in fact, I would even say it\u0026rsquo;s similar to Discover, KDE\u0026rsquo;s app store). You can see it here:\nYou can also now move windows around by holding the Super/Meta key and dragging them around (this works on KDE too!), and there\u0026rsquo;s a whole new Keyboard settings page. Again, all of this is playing catch up, but it means we\u0026rsquo;re getting ready to have a full and stable release of the desktop environment.

Scary.\nWell, it almost happened! A backdoor was recently added to the xz project, used by the vast majority of Linux distributions to compress/decompress files. The malign code managed to get through all reviews and even got to the unstable versions of Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch; it was mostly due to \u0026ldquo;unreasonable luck\u0026rdquo; that Microsoft developer Andres Freund discovered it. He reposted on Mastodon the following words by Damien Miller:\nThis is the nearest of near-misses. Anyone who suggests this was any kind of success is a fool. No system caught this, it was luck and individual heroics. That\u0026rsquo;s not acceptable when unauthorised access to ~every server on the internet is on the table. We need to find a way to do better.\nThe issue has been given a CVSS score of 10, the highest possible score. Here\u0026rsquo;s what Filippo Valsorda, software and cryptography engineer, said about the attack:\nThis might be the best executed supply chain attack we\u0026rsquo;ve seen described in the open, and it\u0026rsquo;s a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized upstream in a widely used library\nHow could something like this have happened?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give some context: \u0026ldquo;XZ\u0026rdquo; is a file format designed by developer Lasse Collin et al between 2005 and 2008. This is now a package used in pretty much any modern distribution to compress and uncompress archives; if you use macOS with homebrew, you also probably have that package. And yet, as is customary in the Open Source world, its development is severely underfunded and mostly driven by just Lasse Collin who, as we will see, seems to be occasionally overwhelmed by the work necessary to maintain it.\nA couple of years ago a developer (or, a group of developers) under the name of Jia Tan starts contributing to the project. They had already done a pull request to libarchive, and their late 2021 patches seem genuine. These patches are sent to the xz-devel mailing list, and Collin merges them into the project.\nThen, there\u0026rsquo;s an entire social engineering attack to make sure that Jia Tan gained access to the project as quickly as possible. They sent a new patch to the xz mailing list, and then (most likely) created multiple fake accounts to pressure the maintainer to merge that patch as soon as possible. Back then he was busy and dealing with longstanding mental health issues, and thus the fake addresses started suggesting him to pass maintainership over.\nThis worked, and Jia Tan was soon given commit rights. They started building the foundations of the backdoor they planned for, plus some other security issues for (maybe?) future plans too. On the most important patch, which implemented a testing system wherein Jia Tan would put the backdoor\u0026rsquo;s binary code, they decided to create yet another fake account to make it seem like it was coming from a different contributor. All of this took years, a lot of effort, and expertise.\nThe attack began in February when Jia Tan added the backdoor\u0026rsquo;s code to the testing system of the project as a binary file. (It\u0026rsquo;s normal for a compression library to have binary files for testing purposes, it\u0026rsquo;s less common for them to be backdoors). The following day they tagged a new release, 5.6.0, and added some extra files to the packages (not to be found in the repository) that would trigger the backdoor when installed in deb/rpm systemd-based systems.\nThen, they started using fake accounts again to pressure distributions to include this new version as soon as possible, citing new great features. However, Jia Tan\u0026rsquo;s plan had an issue: the backdoor code was causing Valgrind errors. They had to fix them before distributions dug too deep and discovered the whole plan. Thus, they released a \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; fix for the Valgrind issue (which had no effect), and also fixed the backdoor by changing the binary files (claiming that they had to be generated with a new random seed). They released a new version (5.6.1) with these new changes and started pressuring again for xz 5.6.1 to be included in Debian and Ubuntu.\nFinally, on the 28th, developer Andres Freund discovered the bug. He immediately notified Debian and other distributions. Debian rolled back to xz 5.4.5, Arch Linux started building xz from Git instead of relying on the tarball, and RedHad assigned the Critical Vulnerability code of 2024-3094. The following day, Andres Freund also published his findings publicly.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s great speculation over who exactly this \u0026ldquo;Jia Tan\u0026rdquo; might be, though most security experts seem to think they\u0026rsquo;re an organized group rather than a single individual. The timezone of the commits would place them in China (working after job hours, even at 1PM), but there are theories of the real timezone being UTC+2/UTC+3, which would place them in Eastern Europe (working during job hours). As an example, the theory relies on the fact that some commits used that timezone and that Jia Tan never worked during Eastern festivities but often worked during Chinese ones. We might never know.\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/xz-backdoor-everything-you-need-to-know/?ref=techhut.tv\nKubuntu has a Brand New Brand Identity! # I mentioned in a past newsletter that Kubuntu was having a contest for new wallpapers and a new brand guide.

What\u0026rsquo;s new?\nFirstly, there\u0026rsquo;s a new global search function within the Files applications. You enter a query and see all matches from the \u0026ldquo;configured search locations\u0026rdquo;, meaning that the exact folders to search in will be customizable. This will also search within the file contents and allow filtering based on file type and modification date. Even better, you will be able to search within the Files preferences to find specific settings.\nWhenever you copy or move many files in the Files app, a progress bar will appear at the bottom left of the application; clicking on it will reveal a dialog with full information about the running operation. Files should also be much faster when switching between list and grid modes, or when displaying a lot of files.\nGNOME Online Accounts also improved (which is impressive, considering that other desktops - such as KDE Plasma - still mostly lack that feature entirely). There\u0026rsquo;s now support for Microsoft OneDrive, which will let you browse your OneDrive remote files directly from the Files sidebar. The settings page was completely redesigned, there\u0026rsquo;s a new WebDAV account type for integrating online contacts, calendars, and files, and the default web browser will now be used to sign into those accounts (allowing for a wider range of authentication methods).\nLots of the above was implemented thanks to the Sovereign Tech Fund, which awarded the GNOME project with $1M to spend on features such as Online Accounts.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a new Settings page that exposes Touchpad settings (such as: configuring how right clicks are performed with a touchpad, and whether the touchpad should be disabled while typing). Generally speaking, multiple settings pages have been redesigned and their order and navigation have been tweaked to make them more intuitive.\nAlso sponsored by the STF, and Igalia, we have significant Accessibility improvements; there\u0026rsquo;s a new sleep mode to temporarily disable the screen reader Orca, new commands to make Orca report on the system status (battery, CPU, memory usage, …), much better table navigation through keyboard navigation, and even experimental support for Spiel, an \u0026ldquo;exciting next generation speech synthesis API\u0026rdquo; according to the GNOME release.\nThe look and layout of notifications in the clock applet have been improved (see the above screenshot) and it\u0026rsquo;s now possible to expand notifications in the list to use their actions. The on-screen keyboard gained automatic capitalization and new keyboard layouts when entering phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs; also, tap-to-click has been enabled for a \u0026ldquo;more intuitive\u0026rdquo; touch experience.\nGNOME 46 also comes with a variety of small improvements to the built-in application suite, and new applications joining the Circle initiative (called Errands, Letterpress, Switcheroo, Decibels, Fretboard, Graphs, and Railway).

This, as (almost) all of the content on that store, was a mostly-unreviewed and user-submitted theme. Global Themes are incredibly powerful, being able to change not only the look but the behavior of your system too; to do that, they are able to run arbitrary code on your system.\nThis particular theme, Grey Layout, re-used chunks of code of another theme (that\u0026rsquo;s fine!) which, amongst other things, created and deleted a configuration directory. Due to what we can safely assume is a mistake by its creator, this config directory was not set in Grey Layout; as a result, installing the theme would wipe out the config directory, which the theme thought to be \u0026ldquo;~\u0026rdquo;. Yes, it deleted all user data.\nThe theme was immediately pulled off the store. As this is the first time something like this has happened, a conversation started among KDE developers on what can be done to prevent further issues like this. In the short term, we would like to reduce the capabilities of Global Themes to make sure they don\u0026rsquo;t run any arbitrary code but only change the look of the elements. We\u0026rsquo;d also like to improve the warning message in the KDE store to more clearly communicate which KDE addons can be safely installed, and which ones you should be careful with since they could run arbitrary code. Long term, there are conversations around manual moderation of all submitter addons and whether that\u0026rsquo;s feasible, maybe moving the KDE store away from the KDE domain, and more.\nYou can read more about this here:\nhttp://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/kde-store-content/?ref=techhut.tv\nFirst looks at COSMIC development version! # Over the last couple of weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to see the first articles on how to manually install/build the new COSMIC desktop environment on Fedora.

I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what this would mean for the project: maybe you\u0026rsquo;d be able to embed VLC within a webpage to play a video? Or maybe you will be able to play local videos through a remote build of VLC?\nThe team is also working on a big rewrite happening behind the scenes, called Version 4.0. The exact quote as reported by Lowpass (see below) is: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve been rewriting the whole core of VLC\u0026rdquo;. Sounds exciting!\nhttps://www.lowpass.cc/p/vlc-five-billion-downloads-vision-pro-app\nYuzu (Open-Source emulator of the Nintendo Switch) to pay $2.4 million to Nintendo # Ouch!\nNintendo had filed a lawsuit against the Yuzu team on the 26th of February, and it sounds like the project decided to settle the dispute by paying a $2.4 million fee to Nintendo and shutting down its operations. Even worse, Citra, an Open-Source Nintendo 3DS emulator, has also been discontinued as a result of these events.\nA joint statement has been shared by both teams, and it sounds rather unbelievable (as in, it\u0026rsquo;s probably written by Nintendo lawyers); it contains sentences such as \u0026ldquo;yuzu and its team have always been against piracy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;we have been deeply disappointed when users have used our software to leak game content\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;we believe that piracy of video games and on video game consoles should end\u0026rdquo;, and even \u0026ldquo;We hope our actions will be a small step toward ending piracy of all creators’ works\u0026rdquo;, where \u0026ldquo;our actions\u0026rdquo; refer to shutting down operations (with, ehm, a $2.4M fine to pay too).\nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/?ref=techhut.tv\nMozilla’s New CEO Prioritizes Tab Grouping Feature in Firefox # In the picture above, you can see how tab grouping works in other browsers. The idea is fairly simple: you should be able to create \u0026ldquo;groups\u0026rdquo; to organize tabs into. There used to be a similar feature, called \u0026ldquo;Panorama\u0026rdquo;, but it was eventually discontinued; later on, third-party add-ons were created to handle the groups. It seems like 3000 users voted to bring the feature back, and the new Mozilla CEO has appointed a dedicated team working on this. You can read more about this in the article below, though there\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot of clearly ChatGPT-generated text in it too:\nhttps://debugpointnews.com/firefox-tab-grouping/?ref=techhut.tv\n","date":"March 13, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2024/03/cosmic-updates-linux-4/","section":"2024s","summary":"","title":"COSMIC Updates, Linux at 4%, VLC Future Plans, and more!","type":"2024"},{"content":" KDE MegaRelease 6 Is Out! # The KDE MegaRelease 6 includes releases of Plasma 6, KDE Frameworks 6, and multiple KDE applications ported to Qt6. It\u0026rsquo;s the biggest release of KDE software we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in multiple years, and it has been ongoing work since 2019. On a personal note, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on this for years too, and I\u0026rsquo;m extremely excited to share the new features with you.\nQt6 and Wayland by default # KDE Plasma 6 now uses Wayland by default, thanks to the work of the Wayland team who managed to fix all blockers and many of the existing issues with that session. Of course, KDE 6 software is also based on Qt6, which brings performance improvements, extra stability, and bugfixes.\nA New Fancy-Looking Overview # This feature was initially developed by me around March, and GNOME\u0026rsquo;s Overview directly inspires it. It merges the overview of a single desktop and of all desktops together in the same effect, it moves around the desktop with 1:1 animations, it allows to switch between desktops through gestures whilst in the Overview, it has a nice blurred-out backdrop and more.\nInitial HDR support # Thanks to the work of KDE Developer Xaver, KDE Plasma now has an option to toggle HDR in external monitors that support it, and it can play HDR games. Other use cases are also supported, such as playing HDR videos, but they still require some command-line hacking.\nPlasma Panels: Now Floating, New Settings, Dodge Windows # All panels are now floating by default. If you dislike that, you can still turn it off in their settings! And, if you do, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice they have been completely redesigned. Instead of being a thin horizontal bar full of buttons, we now have a dialog with clearly labeled options, each of which has its own graphical representation. There\u0026rsquo;s a new feature too; it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;Dodge Windows\u0026rdquo; and it allows the panel to only auto-hide when it\u0026rsquo;s directly above a window.\nA Breeze Redesign # All Breeze applications received a significant visual redesign in their frames; we no longer have all views contained in a blue frame, but rather they will always extend to the window borders or be separated with other elements by a single-pixel line. This builds on top of hundred of Breeze style improvements that have been implemented in the latest versions of Plasma 5.\nThe Cube Is Back # The beloved \u0026ldquo;Cube\u0026rdquo; effect is back in Plasma 6. Rejoice!\nComplete System Settings Re-Organization # The \u0026ldquo;System Settings\u0026rdquo; application has received a complete re-organization; we\u0026rsquo;ve been discussing how to improve it since years ago and I\u0026rsquo;m particularly happy to see this work included in Plasma 6. There are some graphical improvements too, with some options being moved from the footer to the header area, allowing for a nicer window.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a completely new Setting page (after all, we\u0026rsquo;re KDE, we can\u0026rsquo;t release a major version without a new setting page). It\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;System Sounds\u0026rdquo; and it allows you to switch between the included sound themes; we\u0026rsquo;ve even designed a new one from scratch, called \u0026ldquo;Ocean\u0026rdquo;, to replace Oxygen.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a new setting page that allows you to change the wallpaper; you could previously do that only by right-clicking the desktop, now you can find that in Settings too.\nA New Plasma Mobile Homescreen # Plasma Mobile 6 comes with a completely rewritten homescreen where you can drag and drop application icons around, create folders, and even add widgets in an Android-like fashion. It\u0026rsquo;s completely customizable and should be much more stable compared to the previous homescreen. There\u0026rsquo;s also a welcome screen on first launch that guides you through the setup of the system.\nKdenlive: External Editing of Clips # On the applications side of things, the Kdenlive release includes quite some features; you can now export the video or audio of a certain clip and then edit it externally (e.g. using Audacity for audio); all changes will automatically be reflected in the timeline of your project. You can now create multiple tracks of subtitles (e.g. for different languages), import and export subtitles, and more. Finally, you can now use various interpolations between keyframes, such as bounce and exponential.\nKDE Slimbook V # This is not directly related to the KDE MegaRelease 6, but let\u0026rsquo;s keep everything KDE-related in the same segment! Slimbook and KDE jointly announced a collaboration for a newer model of the KDE Slimbook, which will feature Plasma 6 out of the box. Here are the specs:\nAMD Ryzen 7 7840HS Radeon 780M integrated graphics 16-inch IPS LED display with 2560 by 1600 resolution at 165 Hz and sRGB 100% Up to 8 TB storage NVME PCIE 4.0 Up to 64GB 5600 MHz non-soldered memory 720p webcam with physical switch 68‑watt‑hour battery\n\u0026hellip; and more! # These were just a few of the new features in the MegaRelease, but there\u0026rsquo;s so much more.

Tails is a \u0026ldquo;portable\u0026rdquo; distribution, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s meant to be run live from a USB stick, leaving no trace of itself on the computer it\u0026rsquo;s run on. The goal is to avoid any kind of surveillance, censorship, targeted advertising, or viruses.\nTails 6.0 was rebased on the latest Debian, codenamed Bookworm, and it ships with GNOME 43 out of the box. It comes with extra functionalities to check for possible data loss, it automatically mounts external devices (such as other USB sticks) and updates the built-in software it ships (such as Tor Browser, Electrum, and KeePassXC).\nhttps://linuxiac.com/tails-6-0-is-out-with-a-host-of-improvements/?ref=techhut.tv\nLXQt 2.0 will come with Qt6 and Wayland # The team behind LXQt has published an update on the development of the next major version of the project. The two main goals are to port as many components as possible to Qt6 and implement Wayland support. LxQt 2.0.0 is expected to be released in April, and it will also bring some nice UI changes, such as the new application menu that you can see in the screenshot above.

Well, the screenshot utility - pictured above - has been fully implemented. It supports taking screenshots of specific windows or certain screen areas. Floating Windows Stacks were also completed; this feature allows you to \u0026ldquo;pair tiled windows together across applications like tabs in a web browser\u0026rdquo;. Design is completed for \u0026ldquo;OSD\u0026rdquo;, those popups that appear when you e.g. change the volume, brightness, toggle airplane mode, and so on.\nHowever, a fairly long list of features still being worked on: the Terminal and Text editor applications, the tiling applet to customize wm functionalities, input device settings, app and applet icons, the File application, workspaces, login screen and more.

What\u0026rsquo;s new?\nFirst of all, all of the tooltips in foreign webpages can be translated too, instead of being displayed in the original language. You can now change the suggestions of address bar searching in the \u0026ldquo;Settings \u0026gt; Search\u0026rdquo; settings option. Firefox View, the new left-most pinned tab, now has a search bar to look through open tabs.\nMore significantly, Firefox 123 uses evdev to handle gamepads; apparently, this will allow new kinds of controllers to game in the browser. I\u0026rsquo;m certainly out of the loop, not knowing that people use browsers to play video games at all!\nYou can check out a more in-depth changelog here:\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/02/mozilla-firefox-123-features?ref=techhut.tv\nKubuntu Announces Graphic Design Contest # Kubuntu, the main KDE Ubuntu distribution, is holding a graphic design contest.

Firstly, the deadline is the 31st of March: it\u0026rsquo;s just over a month! Even worse, the contest requires the following: logo design, color palette, typography, brand guidelines, website design templates, social media kit, email templates, digital ad templates, presentation templates, video intro/outro, signage, and environmental graphics. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot! Will we manage to see many high-quality applications?

This is a brief extract from the official announcement:\nThis comes after receiving a lot of valuable feedback and contributions from the community to the plugins already available as open source (Unity, Unreal, and FMOD Studio), and we want to bring those same benefits to the core SDK. This will allow developers to tailor the SDK to their needs, and deliver improved experiences to everyone using the technology. We will also continue our ongoing work on Steam Audio, including the release of bug fixes and new features.\nThe entire codebase is now Apache 2.0, and this includes both the SDK and all the plugins they developed.

She worked on both the Netscape Public License and the Mozilla Public License and became the general manager of mozilla.org. She was later fired, in 2001, but kept her manager role as a volunteer.\nIn 2003, America Online shut down the Netscape browser division and scaled back its involvement in Mozilla. As a direct result, the Mozilla Foundation - a non-profit legally representing the community - was founded. Baker was essential to the process and she became the President of the newly-formed organization. She was also appointed to the five-person Board of Directors.\nTwo years later, the Mozilla community also decided to found the Mozilla Corporation, a for-profit subsidiary of the Foundation. Baker was named CEO of this new entity and was also awarded a seat in the Board of Directors of this entity too, leading her to have core roles in both organizations. In 2008 she stepped down as CEO but was reinstated in 2020. She\u0026rsquo;s now stepping down again. She retains all her other current roles.\nHer leadership has been criticized mostly for her quickly increasing salary while Firefox\u0026rsquo;s market share was dropping quickly. Her pay received a 400% increase in 2018, it reached $3 million in 2020 and $7 million in 2022. In 2020 the Mozilla Corporation laid off roughly 250 employees, leading to the end of projects such as Servo (which is now part of the Linux Foundation instead). Baker blamed this on the COVID-19 crisis, though revenue had risen to record highs in 2019.\nIn 2021, Laura Chambers joined the Board of Directors of the Mozilla Corporation. She had just became the CEO of Willow Innovations, a company producing wearable breast pumps in Mountain View. She is stepping in as the new Mozilla Corporation CEO, though she said she does not seek a permanent role as she\u0026rsquo;d like to move back to Australia later this year for family reasons.\nThe change in leadership comes with a change in vision. Chambers has been tasked with \u0026ldquo;refining\u0026rdquo; the company strategy and strengthening their core product, Firefox. The company has already laid off 60 employees, mostly from the development team. Affected products seem to be VPN, Relay, and the Online Footprint Scrubber (whose Plus version was announced just last week). The new goal is to bring trustworthy AI into Firefox through the Pockets, Content, and AI teams.\nYou can read the official announcement here: https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/a-new-chapter-for-mozilla-laura-chambers-expanded-role/?ref=techhut.tv\nTaliban shut down queer Mastodon instance # Did you know there was a queer Mastodon instance at the queer.af address? I\u0026rsquo;m actually a big fan of creatively using addresses meant for countries to express a different meaning; as an example, I tried - for a long time - to get my hands on the Venezuelan niccolo.ve, before settling on the even weirder nicco.love. As a fun fact, .tv was originally meant for the small nation Tuvalu, which made enough money out of it to fund its entry in the United Nations in 2020.\nHowever, .af is handled by Afghanistan, currently governed by the not-very-LGBT-friendly Taliban. Erin Shepherd, administrator of the instance and key ActivityPub developer, already wanted to shut down the site in April; he certainly did not expect to receive an email from the Afghanistan Ministry of Communications and IT shutting down the domain.\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24071036/queer-af-mastodon-taliban-shut-down-afghanistan?ref=techhut.tv\nA rather exciting Open Public Transport Routing story # Fun fact: to write this newsletter, I skim-read through quite a lot blogposts! There are a few that I mostly follow \u0026ldquo;just in case\u0026rdquo;, as they usually provide developer-oriented content that\u0026rsquo;s too technical or niche for a wider audience. I expected Volker Krause\u0026rsquo;s (KDE developer) blogpost titled \u0026ldquo;FOSDEM 2024 and Open Public Transport Routing\u0026rdquo; to be in that category.\nI was wrong!\nThe issue is: currently, there\u0026rsquo;s no Open-Source solution to check for public transport routes. That service is usually offered by transport operators themselves or companies like Google. We need freely available schedule data, a FOSS routing engine, and someone to run all of that.\nWe already have standards to exchange schedules and, in the EU, there\u0026rsquo;s even regulation making it mandatory. We also have three FOSS routing engines: OTP, Navitia, and MOTIS. OTP is used nationwide in Finland and Norway, and Navitia also covers many areas around the world. In 2023, however, Navitian dropped much of its coverage from their free services and there were many discussion at 37C3 \u0026ldquo;showing a growing demand for a proper alternative\u0026rdquo;.\nThis was the somewhat-boring part! From now on, the blogpost becomes a day-to-day chronicle about different people coming together and finding volunteers and hardware to start this alternative project.

The team has just released a new release that replaced the good old Plasma 5 with the 6 version. If you\u0026rsquo;re a bit confused (Plasma 6 has already been published and I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell you about it?), remember that this is based on \u0026ldquo;RC2\u0026rdquo;, the second beta of the KDE MegaRelease. The stable version is still planned at the end of February. We can also look at the rest of the components in KaOS 2024.01:\nUnder the hood, KaOS 2024.01 is powered by Linux kernel 6.6.14.

Interestingly enough, to try it out you are required to become a supporting member of the project, which is quite affordable (starting at $1/mo). Anyway: what\u0026rsquo;s new?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a new mechanism for system updates in System Settings, which you can see in the above screenshots; it should be \u0026ldquo;super fast\u0026rdquo; and include an option to download new updates automatically. The search function in Settings has also been improved, now providing more relevant results and the title of the section they are matched in. The Shortcut Settings page now has a new \u0026ldquo;Keyboard Layout\u0026rdquo; section to change the layout upon pressing a certain shortcut, plus the ability to change between emoji and Unicode typing modes.\nThe Multitasking View has received some design updates (fun fact: the same applies with Plasma 6 above!).

Firstly, it won\u0026rsquo;t feature Plasma 6: even though it will go out a couple of months after the MegaRelease, there was a unanimous agreement in the Kubuntu Council to stay on Plasma 5 for the time being:\n“I’m the leader of Ubuntu Studio, which also uses Plasma, and would’ve had something to say about any last-minute (at this point) transitions with a lot of panic in my voice”, Eickmeyer adds.\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/02/kubuntu-24-04-wont-use-kde-plasma-6?ref=techhut.tv\nFinally, the 24.04 LTS release will switch to the Calamares universal graphical installer. Previously, Lubuntu was the only Ubuntu derivative using it. However, this means that the Ubuntu Desktop Installer will be ditched!

Whether it\u0026rsquo;s media servers, analytic tools, web services, or download clients, most applications demoed on the channel are running in Docker containers. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over the why, the how, and some of the basics you need to know to start using Docker and implementing it in your network.\nWhat is Docker? # But first, what is it? Docker is a platform that allows you to work with containers and containerized applications. In the world of software and servers, a container is an isolated environment that generally has a single primary application running inside. Containers allow developers and system administrators to create and deploy reproducible images that are similar to packages from a distro\u0026rsquo;s package manager. However, containers don\u0026rsquo;t rely at all on libraries or dependencies from the host system–they come with everything required to run a given application in a known working configuration.\nhttps://youtu.be/q8MRqdqeh8U\nIn addition to the dependency benefit, using Docker and containers makes it really simple to deploy and manage services. Since they are isolated from the host system, whether that\u0026rsquo;s bare metal or a VM, containers also make tearing down and cleaning up easy, so they\u0026rsquo;re a great way to experiment and play with various software and services.\n1. How to install Docker # So, how do you get started using Docker? In general, when I use Docker, it\u0026rsquo;s usually integrated into whatever operating system I tend to be using. Currently, in my UNRAID instance, Docker containers are installed through its applications page. When you install it here, you see a lot of variables that we\u0026rsquo;re going to touch on later. Once something is deployed, the applications are managed through the Docker page going forward.\nI also have a bare metal Ubuntu server with Docker installed. Installing Docker on an Ubuntu server is pretty easy; you can install it with apt using the following commands:\nsudo apt update sudo apt install docker.io If you want the most up-to-date version directly from Docker, you can install it from Docker\u0026rsquo;s official repositories for most major distros, including Ubuntu. The instructions are in Docker\u0026rsquo;s documentation, which can be found at this link.\nAlso, you can check out the \u0026ldquo;convenience script\u0026rdquo; for one of the easiest ways to install it on your system. Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, any future updates will also be available through apt. Here are the commands to install using the script:\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh sudo sh get-docker.sh Regardless of how you install Docker on Ubuntu, the Docker systemd service will automatically start and enable. So, Docker will start automatically if the system is ever rebooted. You can check to see if it is running with the following command:\nsudo systemctl status docker\n2. Manage Docker as a non-root user # One step in the Linux post-installation steps is to manage Docker as a non-root user. To do this, you can add your user account to the docker group. This allows you to run Docker commands without using sudo them every time. However, it is important to note that adding a user to the docker group grants them significant privileges, as Docker allows direct access to the host system. Therefore, exercise caution when granting Docker access to non-root users, as it can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly managed and monitored.\nIf you want to do this, run the following commands:\nsudo groupadd docker sudo usermod -aG docker $USER newgrp docker 3. Docker basics usage # After that, a way to test that everything is working properly is to run the \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; container like this:\nDocker\u0026rsquo;s run command takes the name of a Docker image as its argument; in this case hello-world. It downloads the image if needed and then creates and runs a container based on that image.\nDownloading images is known as \u0026ldquo;pulling\u0026rdquo;, and you can also pull an image manually using the \u0026ldquo;pull\u0026rdquo; command. This can be useful for getting a newer version of an image or initiating the download of a large image for later use.\nFor example, this command pulls the latest Ubuntu container image:\ndocker pull ubuntu\nThen, we can run an Ubuntu container with an interactive session using the -it argument. Since the image is already pulled, this container will start automatically.\ndocker run -it ubuntu\nThis drops into a bash shell running in a fresh Ubuntu container. There\u0026rsquo;s a full Linux file system and basic commands apt are available. To exit the container, hit ctrl-d.\nThe command docker ps gives a view of the containers that Docker is currently managing. By default, it only shows running containers, so the Ubuntu container won\u0026rsquo;t show up since it\u0026rsquo;s now stopped. By adding the -a flag, all containers will be shown:\ndocker ps -a\nOne thing to know about containers is that just creating a container doesn\u0026rsquo;t take up any extra space. Docker works by creating layers on top of the image as files are added or modified. Removing old containers is still a nice way to keep things tidy, and that can be done by running docker rm with the container ID or the name of the container shown by docker ps earlier:\ndocker rm \u0026lt;container name\u0026gt;\nWhen you don’t add a name variable to running a container it will randomly generate one. So, next time I run this Ubuntu container, I’ll be sure to give it a creative name.\nContainers can only be removed when they are stopped, so it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes necessary to stop a running container before removing it, using docker stop:\ndocker stop \u0026lt;container name\u0026gt;\nIf stopping doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, killing the container may also sometimes be necessary:\ndocker kill \u0026lt;container name\u0026gt;\nThis can be compared to closing out an application versus ending the task in Task Manager.\nWhen we remove the Ubuntu container, the hello-world container remains. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover how to clean up old containers more efficiently later.\n4. Volumes and Bind Mounts # When containers are removed, any changes to them, including stored data, will be lost. In general, containers are considered disposable, and they are expected to be periodically replaced, such as during updates. So, any important data that the container uses or generates should be stored separately.\nDocker provides two main mechanisms for storing data persistently on the host system: volumes and bind mounts. Volumes provide a dedicated storage space that can be referenced by name for later use. Bind mounts, on the other hand, are a way of giving a container access to a limited scope of a file system on the host. Bind mounts are what I end up using more than anything, as my main use case is sharing media that I have on the network shares with various docker containers. For example, many of my Arr applications have identical binds to work better together.\nFirst, let us touch on volumes. These can be added to a container by adding the --volume flag (or -v for short) to a docker run command. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example:\ndocker run -it --name ubuntu --volume test:/mnt ubuntu\nThis adds a volume named \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; to a new Ubuntu container and mounts it at /mnt. Now that we are in the container shell, we can create a file inside the volume:\necho test \u0026gt; /mnt/test\nAfter exiting the container shell with ctrl-d, we can see the created volume by listing Docker\u0026rsquo;s volumes with:\ndocker volume ls\nBy default, Docker stores volumes on your host system in the subdirectories of /var/lib/docker/volumes, and we can access the contents like any other file. We\u0026rsquo;d need sudo in this case, if we\u0026rsquo;re not already root:\nsudo cat /var/lib/docker/volumes/test/_data/test\nAnytime we give the same volume name to a future Docker command, it will use the same volume and the same data will be available. The volume can also be removed like this:\ndocker volume rm test\nIn this case, you can see my volume is in use. You can see the last couple we created if I list all stopped containers. The volume is associated with the Ubuntu container, so I must remove it. I could do a docker container rm command but want to remove all my stopped containers. To do this, I can use a prune command.\ndocker container prune\nIt will ask me if I want to remove them all, so I will say yes. This is a command you want to be careful with, so do keep note of that. The prune command also works with images, volumes, networks, and everything else.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another example of how bind mounts work. In this case, we\u0026rsquo;ll mount the root user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. The invocation is very similar; we just substitute the host path in place of a volume name:\ndocker run -it --name ubuntu --volume /root:/mnt ubuntu\nNow, inside the home folder, it will be available under /mnt inside the container:\nls /mnt\nIn this case, there\u0026rsquo;s just a copy of the Docker install script I used to install Docker into this instance:\nBe careful with bind mounts since any changes the container makes will also be permanently made on the host system. Generally, giving containers access to the minimum necessary set of files and folders from the host is a good idea.\n5. Docker Networking # So now, moving on to the network side. Docker provides a networking stack that can isolate containers from each other and the host system on the network level. By default, containers are added to a default \u0026ldquo;bridge\u0026rdquo; network where they can communicate with each other but can\u0026rsquo;t reach the host system or any other devices in the host network.\nPorts from specific containers can also be exposed to the outside world. If that port is also open in the host system\u0026rsquo;s firewall, it becomes a service available on the host\u0026rsquo;s network. When using \u0026ldquo;docker run\u0026rdquo;, a port can be exposed using the -p option like this:\ndocker run -p 8080:80 nginx\nThe two numbers separated by the colon are port numbers. In this case, port 8080 on the host is mapped to port 80 inside the container. To check that it\u0026rsquo;s working, open a web browser and enter localhost:8080 in the address bar (or for a remote server, after opening the firewall for Nginx, replace localhost with the server\u0026rsquo;s IP address or domain). If everything is working right, the welcome page from Nginx should load.\nDocker\u0026rsquo;s other primary network driver is called \u0026ldquo;host\u0026rdquo; networking, which gives containers direct access to the host\u0026rsquo;s network stack. This mode provides some benefits that are especially helpful when high-performance or low-level networking operations are required. It\u0026rsquo;s also conceptually simpler but less flexible and potentially less secure since the containers aren\u0026rsquo;t isolated.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the previous example again with host networking:\ndocker run --net=host nginx\nIn this case, nginx will bind directly to port 80 on the host, so it should be reachable from a web browser just by typing \u0026ldquo;localhost\u0026rdquo; or the host machine\u0026rsquo;s IP address.\n6. Docker Compose # Now, when you go to spin up a container, you may see normal Docker commands like this in their documentation, but you may see instructions for Docker Compose instead. Compose is primarily a system for orchestrating groups of containers that work together, but it can also be used with single containers.\nFor example, a web application might include a database and a web server. Each can run in separate containers as part of a single Docker Compose deployment managed as a single unit.\nWhen using Compose, containers in the same deployment by default share a single Docker bridge mode network that\u0026rsquo;s separate from the usual default network. Each container gets an IP address in a subnet unique to that network. Docker also provides a DNS system so containers can resolve the IP address of other containers using their container name.\nEach group of containers managed by compose is defined in a docker-compose.yaml file. In the simplest form, this file specifies names for each container and which image they use. Networking, volumes, and many other options can also be specified to control the containers\u0026rsquo; behavior and how they work together.\nMany Docker Compose files are available online, and they are easy to get started with. Just download the docker-compose.yaml file, navigate to the folder where you saved the yaml file, and after any necessary edits, run:\ndocker compose up -d\nThis single command will set up everything defined in the yaml file. The -d flag tells Docker to run the deployment in the background and return control of the shell. Logs for the containers won\u0026rsquo;t be printed to the console in this case, but they can be accessed with:\ndocker compose logs\nTo stop a Compose deployment later, just run:\ndocker compose down\nThis will stop and remove all of the containers. By default, the data stored in volumes is retained. You can also remove the volume data by adding the -v flag:\ndocker compose down -v\n7. Updating Containers # The basic method for updating a container is to pull a newer version of the container image, remove the container, and then start a new container using the new image version. This is one reason storing data inside volumes is important—it\u0026rsquo;s the only way data can survive this process.\nWatchtower is a service for keeping containers up to date, which runs inside a container. It detects whenever a new version is available and automatically replaces containers with the new version using the same settings they were created with. It\u0026rsquo;s very simple to set up and works great in our experience. See the Watchtower site for more details.\nConclusion # Now you should have a good base-level knowledge of Docker, which is necessary to start managing applications and services. If you want to dive deeper, there are many great videos and articles out there with great information.

Firstly, the CRA now only applies to commercial activity, which is great news for Open Source organizations: sure, you can write Free Software and still have a commercial activity, but many of them don\u0026rsquo;t. Even better: receiving financial support or accepting donations without the intention of making a profit won\u0026rsquo;t be considered commercial activity. Even if you do receive money for development, you shall not be considered a commercial activity if the organization is set up in a way that ensures that all earnings after cost are used to achieve not-for-profit objectives. Finally, if someone is using your project and making money out of it but not you, it\u0026rsquo;s still not a commercial activity on your side of things. These new definitions are much wider compared to the previous versions and much more reasonable; most Open-Source organizations should be safe from them. I would say this is a great win for the FOSS world!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in a much deeper analysis of the latest version of the CRA, you will find it here:\nhttps://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-what-does-it-mean-for-open-source/?ref=techhut.tv\nElementaryOS 7 updates, getting ready for v. 8 # Danielle Foré, CEO of Elementary, has published a blogpost illustrating the new changes in the latest version of ElementaryOS 7. Firstly, you can see above the new look for the Tab Overview in the GNOME Web. This overview is a new libadwaita component that will be used consistently throughout different applications. The update also contains various fixes for the Window Manager, and a new version of Network Settings which support Wireguard VPNs.\nThe full blogpost also contains some insight into what ElementaryOS 8 will bring: there\u0026rsquo;s GTK4 porting work going on, an entire new Dock that has just gotten improved Drag and Drop (plus badges and progressbars), and more.\nhttps://blog.elementary.io/updates-for-january-2024/?ref=techhut.tv\nThe Ideal Monitor Rotation # The above picture is taken by a blogpost published on the 2nd of December by user \u0026ldquo;sprocketfox\u0026rdquo;. I had initially thought that this was meant to showcase weird Linux functionalities and not much more, but since then the story has been picked up by The Verge and I discovered that there\u0026rsquo;s more thought about it. Though Windows and macOS only allow for 90° and 180° rotation, you can use xrandr on Linux to achieve pretty much any transformation.\nThis means you\u0026rsquo;re effectively free to rotate the monitor however you prefer. Sprocketfox has found that a typical horizontal monitor setup does not work well when reading websites and documents, whereas a 90° rotated setup will have issues displaying videos and movies. After multiple tests with different angles, he has found 22° to be his ideal rotation (pictured above). This is because it provides, on a 21:9 screen ratio, the longest possible line length. The number might be different depending on your screen ratio, but he provides a nice little tool to generate a xrandr command given the desired angle and X,Y shifts:\nhttps://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/2021/12/02/xrandr/?ref=techhut.tv\n","date":"January 10, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2024/01/linux-foundation-report-ai-audacity-elementaryos/","section":"2024s","summary":"","title":"The Linux Foundation Report, AI in Audacity, ElementaryOS 7 update, and more!","type":"2024"},{"content":" Linux Marketshare at an all-time high! # Graph by GamingOnLinux (see link below)\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy to report that the Linux market share is at an all-time high according to two reports. Firstly, we have \u0026ldquo;Statcounter\u0026rdquo;, whose results over time you can see above. The spike in December 2023 is easy to see, but - even better! - it\u0026rsquo;s part of a clear positive trend overall.\nWe also have the monthly Steam report, which only measures Steam users rather than attempting to extrapolate data for the general population. Because of that, the number is lower (1.97%); nonetheless, it\u0026rsquo;s the highest value it has ever been in years. Again, we can easily see a positive trend most likely driven by SteamDeck sales.\nThough it\u0026rsquo;s hard to measure Linux market share correctly, it is certainly a good sign that multiple trackers tell us that more and more people are using our favorite kernel.\nhttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/linux-use-on-steam-ends-2023-with-a-multi-year-high-thanks-steam-deck/?ref=techhut.tv\nScribus publishes a new major version # For those out of the loop, Scribus is the largest open-source desktop publishing app; you can use it for books, newspapers, brochures, posters, and so on. The latest version is 1.6 and brings an official dark mode, new icons, HiDPI-aware canvas rendering, and a new PDF-based output preview. We also get the ability to search throughout all the actions available to the application, a feature that\u0026rsquo;s slowly starting to appear in many Linux applications (as an example, it\u0026rsquo;s Ctrl+Alt+I in KDE apps). We also get two new actions: \u0026ldquo;Weld\u0026rdquo; - to combine objects - and \u0026ldquo;Symbol\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can check out the full changelog here: https://9to5linux.com/scribus-1-6-open-source-desktop-publishing-app-released-as-a-major-update?ref=techhut.tv\nDoes Wayland really break everything? # I would like to tell you above a very nice article written by KDE developer Nate Graham; it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;Does Wayland really break everything?\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s a direct reply to the document \u0026ldquo;Wayland breaks everything!\u0026rdquo; by one of the core AppImage developers. It explains that Wayland is not meant to be a drop-in replacement for X11; it does not have more issues compared to the status quo, it just has a different set of problems. X11 is a bad platform: it tries to do too much, and it ended being quite buggy, with applications having to fight against it.

The new version, codenamed Orchid, was introduced as a concept roughly eight months ago and has been actively developed ever since. However, it required some significant structural changes: even the base, which used to be Ubuntu, was swapped out in favor of Debian. This was done in an extremely modular way, so that you can change entire set of applications and built-in software to make your custom install. It\u0026rsquo;s a very nice concept that\u0026rsquo;s throughoutly illustrated in the original blogpost:\nhttps://vanillaos.org/blog/article/2023-03-07/vanilla-os-20-orchid\u0026mdash;initial-work?ref=techhut.tv\nGNOME To-Do application looks awesome, and more! # The latest issue of \u0026ldquo;This Week in GNOME\u0026rdquo; contains some very nice now features and releases. The first one, which you can see above, is \u0026ldquo;Errands\u0026rdquo;, a GNOME Circle to-do application. The latest version comes with multiple task lists - which you can see on the left sidebar - but also: notes, start and due date, priority, tag and percentage of completion for each task. You can also see the existing feature for task colors as well. The new multiple task lists can support the multiple calendar feature for CalDAV and Nextcloud Tasks, and all the above properties will be synced as well. Finally, you can export and import in the standard \u0026ldquo;.ics\u0026rdquo; format. All of these features now make Errands a viable option for a main task manager tool!\nYou can find the above, and many more changes, in the full blogpost here:\nhttps://thisweek.gnome.org/posts/2023/12/twig-128/?ref=techhut.tv\n","date":"January 3, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2024/01/linux-marketshare-gnome-circle/","section":"2024s","summary":"","title":"Linux Marketshare rises, GNOME Circle apps, Scribus 1.6 and more!","type":"2024"},{"content":"","date":"December 27, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2023/","section":"2023s","summary":"","title":"2023s","type":"2023"},{"content":" GNOME development is greatly benefiting from the Sovereign Tech Fund # The amount of work that\u0026rsquo;s currently happening in the GNOME projects thanks to the developers hired using the Sovereign Tech Fund is impressive. Firstly, we have Alice working on adaptive bottom sheet resizing (see above video). This allows bottom sheets to stay centered in bigger applications but to move to the bottom and fill the width on smaller ones (e.g. phone apps). We also have Julian working on making the Quick Setting popup scrollable, since it might not fit in the screen of smaller devices. Georges made sure that applications requesting a screenshot of the screen/of an application will use the UI for GNOME Shell screencasting. And these are just a few UI examples: there are lots of other developers (Adrian, Joanie, Ivan, Philip, Tobias) working on more behind-the-scenes features.\nAnd, of course, there\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; development still happening as well. GNOME has just launched a new webpage, welcome.gnome.org, which explains how the community works and how you can get involved. I strongly recommend going through the full weekly blogpost, as it features all the information that I have condensed here with screenshots and videos, plus all the third-party work that\u0026rsquo;s happening too:\nKDE KWin will have Dynamic Triple Buffering # Both the GNOME and KDE projects now have implementations of Dynamic Triple Buffering, though neither has landed yet. Though I will defer the technical explaination to a window manager expert of your choice, Dynamic Triple Buffering can \u0026ldquo;ramp up the GPU clocks to deliver better performance\u0026rdquo;, managing to double the fps in some scenarios. The patch on the KWin side was done by developer Xaver Hugl, who also has been working on the implementation of HDR in KDE Plasma.\nNobara 39 Released, featuring KDE Plasma # Nobara is a Fedora Linux downstream meant for more gamer-focused tasks, and it comes with some extra drivers and gaming consoles patches out of the box. The Nobara team has decided to change the desktop of Fedora Workstation with KDE Plasma, though vanilla GNOME builds are also available. The release updates various of the projects it ships with (OBS Studio, NVIDIA graphic drivers, \u0026hellip;) and adds some SteamDeck OLED patches, CoreCtrl support, patched GLFW for native Wayland support, and more. You can check out the full changelog here:\nEnlightenment releases a new Stable version # It has been two years since the last stable version of the Enlightenment desktop; version 0.26 was released on the 23rd mostly focusing on bug fixing. However, it does contain some new features too: task previews have been made larger, there\u0026rsquo;s support for freedesktop ScreenSaver inhibit API, there\u0026rsquo;s an API to spawn test notifications, and more. You can read the full announcement here:\nZorin OS 17 Officially Released # I\u0026rsquo;m happy to report that Zorin OS 17 has officially been released. I had reported on this a few newsletters ago, but I had failed to mention that only the beta had been released, whereas now we do have the stable release.\nAs a quick summary, most new changes come from new features of projects that Zorin OS relies on: we have the new GNOME Quick settings menu and Overview, better search in the Zorin Menu, the latest GNOME Software application, \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; window tiling, the desktop cube plug-in, and more.\nA remarkable choice by Zorin was to provide an advanced version of their operating system, Zorin OS Pro, available for a one-time purchase of 48€. This comes with some extra themes and layouts and more pre-installed applications; it\u0026rsquo;s particularly relevant now since all of those who bought Zorin OS 16 Pro will now have to pay for the new version as well, since the one-time purchase does not give you right to claim the successive Pro versions of the OS.\nFirefox to experiment with \u0026ldquo;MemoryCache\u0026rdquo; Local AI # \u0026ldquo;MemoryCache\u0026rdquo; is a Mozilla Innovation Project to automate the creation of a context-aware AI application based on your browser activity. It would be presented as a Firefox extension allowing for features such as conversations about the visited webpages, the ability to save webpages locally to analyze them offline, and so on.\nCurrently, the project is a set of tools to \u0026ldquo;augment\u0026rdquo; a local copy of privateGTP; developers are still working on adding an UI and additional features around it.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the text editor; we can see how some new features are quite basic, such as \u0026ldquo;double-click to select word\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;triple-click to select line\u0026rdquo;. That makes sense: again, System76 is trying to build a desktop from scratch and they will have to work on these types of things too.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s some cool stuff as well: there\u0026rsquo;s now a context drawer that allows you to search throughout a project (see screenshot above). Git status and git changes support were also added, meaning that you can compare different versions of the same files with an intuitive interface (deleted lines in red, added lines in green).\nYou can now set a shortcut to move your entire workspace (a.k.a. all open windows ) to the next display, and there\u0026rsquo;s a more intuitive logic that selects which monitor to switch to. Support was also added to automatically move windows between monitors when plugged in/out.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the project development, make sure to check out the full blogpost, which also comes with extra screenshots:\nFlipboard and Threads are joining the Fediverse # Both Threads and Flipboard are beginning to experiment with the ActivityPub protocol. Both platforms offered a limited amount of accounts to opt-in to this feature, which will make those users visible and interactable by any ActivityPub-based social network, such as Mastodon. Both platforms plan to slowly expand on this feature so that anyone can benefit from this; however, that\u0026rsquo;s going to take some work.\nAs an example, replies to Thread posts written by e.g. Mastodon users will not appear on the Thread app, but developers are working on it. Mosseri, Instagram head, also said that they plan to allow Thread accounts to move to a different app/server whilst retaining all of their followers. Flipboard CEO Mike McCue is even more direct: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re in the process of replacing our whole social back-end with ActivityPub\u0026rdquo;; this will make Flipboard effectively the same as any other ActivityPub-based platform, such as Mastodon or Pixelfed.\nW4 Games raises $15M to develop Godot Engine # Wait, what\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;W4 Games\u0026rdquo;?\nWell, it\u0026rsquo;s a company recently founded by three Godot Engine veterans (Juan Linietsky, Rémi Verschelde, and Fabio Alessandrelli) and one entrepreneur (Nicola Farronato) to strengthen the open source Godot ecosystem; they plan to do that by offering \u0026ldquo;commercial products and services\u0026rdquo; to companies.\nIt is not unusual for large non-profit open-source projects to also be backed by for-profit companies; we don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how beneficial W4 Games will be to the Godot ecosystem, but it is certainly good news that they managed to raise $15M in funding to start their work. They plan to work on projects such as W4 Consoles (a middleware console porting solution for Godot games) and W4 Cloud (\u0026ldquo;multi-tenant service to support millions of users\u0026rdquo;).\nPlasma Mobile is getting ready for a new Major Release! # KDE Plasma 6 will be released towards the end of February; this will be a mega-release, meaning it will include the desktop, applications, frameworks, and Plasma Mobile. Devin, one of the core developers of the project, has published a blogpost explaining all the work he is doing to prepare the release.\nOne of the most user-visible changes will be the home-screen; Plasma Mobile used to have a very Android-like home, which drag-and-droppable apps and widgets, and a application grid that\u0026rsquo;s accessible by swiping from the bottom of the screen. However, this home-screen was not stable enough and was known to brick the shell; because of that, one year ago Plasma Mobile switched to a different home-screen called \u0026ldquo;Halcyon\u0026rdquo;. This one simply provided a list of applications the user could scroll through.\nDevin has spent the last five weeks completely rewriting the classic \u0026ldquo;Folio\u0026rdquo; home-screen. You can see how good it looks in the above screenshots, and it should now be stable enough to be used out-of-the box by the Plasma Mobile project. It supports: an app drawer, KRunner search, folders, pages, widgets, customizable row and columns, customizable page transitions, ability to import-export layout files, and more.\nThe full blogpost contains a lot of technical details too, and it\u0026rsquo;s a great read if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the project:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

It performs, you guessed it, a global search throughout all Nextcloud (supported) apps, and you can filter by date and people. Even cooler, though, is the fact that you can select which application to search in, and these include integrations such as GitLab, GitHub, OpenStreetMap, PeerTube, Reddit, and so on; this means you can search through all of those projects as well, all in a single search bar.\nThere are various improvements on the AI side of things. Firstly, there\u0026rsquo;s a new UI for the Assistant, which has its button in the top bar and allows you to craft your prompt. Nextcloud allows you to switch between different models depending on whether you want an open-source one or not, running locally or not, and so on. Hub 7 brings a couple of new cool integrations: Aleph Alpha, a text-based model that processes your data in Germany, and Stable Diffusion to generate images running locally. You can also make sure the costs of these features are under control by setting the maximum amount of tokens/images each user can generate.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a teaser for the future too: Nextcloud collaborated with the German state of Schleswig-Holstein to bring \u0026ldquo;Context Chat\u0026rdquo;, which will allow most text-based models (including those running locally) to search through your data and files to provide answers that are tailored for you.\nHowever, there\u0026rsquo;s so much more to it. Nextcloud is a massive project, and I would recommend you to go through the entire official announcement if you use it:\nFramasoft announces Mobilizon v4 # What\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mobilizon\u0026rdquo;, you might ask?\nIn the previous newsletter, I covered the latest update in the decentralized video system \u0026ldquo;PeerTube\u0026rdquo; by Framasoft, and their ongoing fundraiser. This update is similar: the organization is announcing the first \u0026ldquo;mature\u0026rdquo; version of the decentralized alternative to Facebook groups and events. Development started in December 2018 thanks to 1,000 donors and v4 now offers private announcements and conversations, the ability to import information from other platforms (such as Facebook and Meetup), and so on.\nI quite like this approach to offering multiple services, all part of the Fediverse, that each implements one core functionality of proprietary alternatives instead of creating one big project that\u0026rsquo;s tasked to deal with all of them simultaneously. Thus, you\u0026rsquo;re more than welcome to help Framasoft develop these alternative platforms!\nAustrian Game Studio now supports Krita # You might\u0026rsquo;ve heard (even in this newsletter) about large donations and generous support from big game studios towards Godot and Blender, as replacements for Unity. However, this week it is Krita - an open-source graphics editor by KDE - who managed to get a stable supporter. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about \u0026ldquo;Broken Rules\u0026rdquo;, a Vienna-based game development studio that has produced games such as Old Man\u0026rsquo;s Journey and Gibbon: Beyond the Trees. This is great news for the project, and it always makes me happy to know that there are for-profit companies out there actively supporting the free and open-source projects they rely on.\nNews in AI: Google flops Gemini, EU agrees on AI Act # https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIZAiXYceBI?feature=oembed\nGoogle has recently announced a new AI product, called \u0026ldquo;Gemini\u0026rdquo;, whose goal is to finally rival - and maybe beat - GTP4. They did this in great fashion: they published a video showing Gemini interacting in real-time with a user based on their voice and a constant camera feed. You can see it above: it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also fake. The model was given much more precise prompts, which were cut out, and Gemini output was also \u0026ldquo;shortened\u0026rdquo;. Also, the \u0026ldquo;video feed\u0026rdquo; part of it was a lie: Gemini was fed screenshots and text prompts, which were then edited together to look like the video you see above. Overall, the news that Google pushed out such a misleading promotional video managed to outnoise the original announcement itself; it does not help that Gemini is not yet publicly available.\nAnd now, for something completely different: EU has reached a provisional agreement on the \u0026ldquo;AI Act\u0026rdquo;, which would be the first comprehensive set of rules to govern AI. We don\u0026rsquo;t have the final text that was agreed upon - it will be available in the upcoming weeks - but we have a rough idea of what it should feature. (As a bit of a fun fact, I met today MEP Brando Benifei, who negotiated the text on the Parliament side; I briefly asked about the act\u0026rsquo;s final text, but without snagging any private information ;-).\nSome uses of AI will be prohibited: social credit scoring systems, emotion recognition at work and education, scraping of facial images, predictive policing, and so on. Other AI uses will be marked as \u0026ldquo;High-risk\u0026rdquo; (medical devices, vehicles, recruitment, \u0026hellip;) and will have to abide by a special set of requirements (impact assessments, conformity assessments, \u0026hellip;).

The latest version includes many quality-of-life improvements, some of which are not available on competing platforms.\nFirstly, you can protect videos with passwords. Creators can set a single password when they upload or import the settings of their videos. Developer Wicklow did this during an internship.\nSecondly, hovering the mouse on the video progress bar will show a thumbnail of that specific timestamp. This feature is called \u0026ldquo;Storyboards\u0026rdquo;; the previews will be generated when a video is uploaded, but instance admins can dedicate some CPU time to create them for existing videos too.\nThirdly, you can now change the video after it has been published. On competing platforms, such as YouTube, this is only available to bigger channels that have direct partnerships with the platform.\nFinally, PeerTube now features chapters. These work similarly to YouTube\u0026rsquo;s, and they will be automatically imported from them. Quoting the official announcement: when chapters are set, markers will appear and segment the progress bar. Chapter titles will be displayed when you hover or touch one of these chapter segments.\nAll of this was developed by Framasoft, a French non-profit organization and collective founded respectively in 2002 and 2004. They develop distributed services and offer them freely to users. They\u0026rsquo;re currently running a fundraiser; you can check everything about both PeerTube and Framasoft here:\nRoundcube (FOSS email client) joins Nextcloud # You might not have heard of Roundcube, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very popular open-source email platform. It\u0026rsquo;s an IMAP client, but it also offers a Webmail Client (pictured above). The project is used by Harvard, Cambridge, the European Commission, HostGator, and GoDaddy.\nThe direct consequences of this partnership are somewhat unclear. Nextcloud has its own \u0026ldquo;competing\u0026rdquo; product, and they\u0026rsquo;ve stated they don\u0026rsquo;t want a direct merger between the two; quoting the announcement: neither will Roundcube replace Nextcloud Mail or the other way around. The idea is to strengthen the world of open-source alternatives to closed-sourced software.\nCinnamon 6.0 lands with initial Wayland support # Development of Cinnamon 6 was recently completed, and the final release landed on GitHub. The major feature of 6 is the Wayland session; however, it\u0026rsquo;s still in an experimental stage, and bug reports are particularly appreciated to improve it over time. The new Wayland session also supports experimental fractional scaling for HiDPI screens; however, some other desktop features don\u0026rsquo;t have full support yet and have been disabled.\nOther new features include Telegram Desktop audio playing appearing in the Sound applet, support for AVIF images, a new gesture for desktop zoom, color picker support in the screenshot service, and a xdg-portal configuration file. The desktop will be used in the next Linux Mint release, due in just a couple of weeks.\nZorin OS 17 released with Quick Settings, Spatial Desktops, and More # The newly-released Zorin OS 17 uses an interesting approach to deliver an updated desktop experience: though it\u0026rsquo;s still based on Ubuntu 22.04, which uses GNOME 42, Zorin OS 17 ships with GNOME 43. This allows them to include many of the new GNOME features, such as Quick Settings, full GTK4 theming, new Power modes, new screenshot and recording experiences, and a refined Activities Overview.\nThe team has also decided to include some extensions/effects out of the box. The most noticeable one is the \u0026ldquo;Spatial Workspace Switcher\u0026rdquo;, which replaces the standard Alt+Tab and Super+Tab dialogs with a 3D window switcher; you\u0026rsquo;ll also have the Desktop Cube, which you can freely rotate to switch between desktops.\nThe Zorin OS-specific features are all about layouts. Though the desktop is based on GNOME 43, Zorin gives it a very unique spin. You can see above a quite classic layout, but version 17 will come with two new layouts that imitate GNOME 2 and Google\u0026rsquo;s Chrome OS desktops. However, these will only be available in the Zorin OS 17 Pro edition.\nMozilla Foundation has four new Board Members # Mozilla recently announced that it has expanded its board. The new members are: Alondra Nelson, Edwin Macharia, Raffi Krikorian, and Zain Habboo. The idea is to expand the scope of the Mozilla Project, working closely with the Boards of the Mozilla Corporation, Mozilla.ai and Mozilla Ventures. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a super-board for the entirety of the company and its various projects.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the background of each of the new members, you can find them here:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

This month, the team has put together various smaller features or details that are required for a full-fledged desktop environment. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with window arrangement. If tiling is turned off, there\u0026rsquo;s now a logic that establishes where new windows will open: always near the center of the screen, offset by 48px (or multiples) from the previous window, while also keeping the top-right corner of the window header visible. You can see an example in the screenshot above. Similarly to other desktops, shortcuts to tile windows to the left/right halves of the screen should be implemented as well.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also great progress in the text editor development. The current features include window tabs, organizing files by project, Vim-style editing shortcuts, background change detection for new edits to your file, and color-coded syntax highlighting.\nWhilst implementing the Appearance and Wallpaper system settings designs, COSMIC developers decided to introduce two new \u0026ldquo;widgets\u0026rdquo; (UI components): Dropdown and ImageButton. The former allows for advanced menus with multiple lists of options and separators between them; the latter is a rounded-border accented-outline button that can be checked like a button but it displays an image. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any screenshots of it yet, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to imagine it based on this description alone.\nThen, some more technical details: the COSMIC audio applet now supports the MPRIS audio interface (which allows you to see track list and basic playback control), the compositor now supports custom theming and Input Method Editor to enter text using syllabaries (such as Chinese and Japanese), there\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;security context support\u0026rdquo; to prevent certain applications to access special system privileges, and XDG/DBus activation is now supported.\nFinally, some nice collaboration: thanks to the efforts of Victoria (COSMIC engineer), Xaver (KDE Developer), and Joshua (a Valve contractor), HDR is in the works. There\u0026rsquo;s already basic support in KDE (though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t include EDID, which many games require), and COSMIC should eventually gain it too.\nGNOME\u0026rsquo;s Sovereign Tech Fund development started # I recently reported how GNOME managed to get €1M from the Sovereign Tech Fund; however, I was initially worried about how the money would be used, as the STF does have some limitations and goals to adhere to. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to report that the GNOME project decided to report weekly on the progress, and the activity is really impressive.\nFirstly, Ivan Molodetskikh is improving GNOME Shell/Mutter profiling instrumentation and adding integration for a new profiler. As part of this work, he has already discovered several performance bugs which have been already either fixed or addressed in a pending merge request.\nJulian Sparber and Jonas Dreßler are working on notifications, and this immediately comes with a great user-facing benefit: grouping of notifications by app is being implemented! This is going to be a great space-saver in the notification widget.\nAdrian Vovk has added support for systems homed in AccountService, which is the first step towards safer encryption with a nice user experience. Georges Stavracas and Huber Figuère are improving XDG Desktop Portals, with some nice user-facing changes: it\u0026rsquo;s now possible to drag and drop between sandboxed applications, a bug preventing ejection of USB flash drives has been fixed, and developer documentation has been improved.\nAndy Holmes is working on improving GNOME Online Accounts (which were already one of the best in the Linux world); this includes CalDAV/CardDAV support, a port to GTK4, using the preferred browser for OAuth2, and more.\nSam Hewitt is working on fixing accessibility issues in the GNOME Shell stylesheet (which defines the look of the desktop); Joanie Diggs is improving the Orca screen reader, accessibility documentation, and more.\nFinally, Jonas Dreßler is also working on hardware-accelerated screencasts and improvements in the Linux Bluetooth stack; Emmanuel Gil Peyrot is implementing session recovery from a GPU driver crash, which is a requirement for some newer graphical features that aren\u0026rsquo;t well-tested on GPU drivers.\nAll of this is\u0026hellip; a lot, and it manages to communicate that €1M is not an abstract number but, rather, it allows to hire multiple developers to work on core aspects of the Shell with immediate benefits to all users.\nKrita\u0026rsquo;s AI Plugin beats Photoshop\u0026rsquo;s Generative Fill # Though Krita itself has no intention to add AI features to the application, the \u0026ldquo;Krita AI Diffusion\u0026rdquo; plugin has recently added a significant amount of features that make it a very appealing alternative to Photoshop\u0026rsquo;s Generative Fill. On top of that, the plugin relies on Stable Diffusion, which is one of the few models that\u0026rsquo;s considered somewhat \u0026ldquo;Open Source\u0026rdquo; (as in, the weight is public, and so is the training data).\nSo, what can it do? Firstly, you can select an area and (optionally) a prompt to generate multiple alternatives. You can also generate a full image in one go. There\u0026rsquo;s also a slider that controls how much the existing image should have an impact on the result, depending on the fidelity to the original image you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. You can also create a crude scribble and turn that into a full image, and it comes with an integrated upscaling tool to improve the quality. It even includes a pose editor and live painting.\nThe entire plugin is Open Source and runs locally on your machine; no data is sent through the Internet.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

When the previous newsletter issue was published, Sam Altman was the CEO; now he isn\u0026rsquo;t, but the company just said he\u0026rsquo;ll be right back.\nOn Friday, Sam Altman was removed from the role of CEO by OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s board. No detailed explanation was given, and the move felt hurried; the CTO, Mira Murati, temporarily took his place. One of the board members, Greg Brockman, resigned in protest. It\u0026rsquo;s important to point out that, since OpenAI was originally non-profit, the board does not have the goal of maximizing revenue - their goal is to guide the company safely toward its AI future.\nNegotiations to reinstate Altman began the same day. Many OpenAI employees were immediately on Sam\u0026rsquo;s side, and even Mira Murati switched to his side. However, no agreement was found and the board decided to remove Mira Murati, appointing Emmet Shear (ex-Twitch funder) as a replacement.\nAs chances of Altman returning to OpenAI seemed to vanish, Microsoft (who did not seem to know this was going to happen and was reportedly furious) decided to hire both Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to start a new AI division. As a result, a letter was written by OpenAI employees threatening to quit and join Microsoft unless the board reinstated Altman. Out of the 770 employees of OpenAI, roughly 700 signed the letter.\nEven board member Ilya, who had voted to fire Altman, announced he regretted his actions and signed it. (It seems like he was convinced by Greg Brockman\u0026rsquo;s wife. Sutskever had officiated their wedding at OpenAI headquarters. Yeah). The current CEO, Emmet Shear, reportedly threatened to resign unless the board could provide documentation of Altman\u0026rsquo;s wrongdoing.\nJust a few hours ago, the company announced that, yes, Sam Altman will return as CEO of OpenAI. The attempted boardroom coup has failed, though we still don\u0026rsquo;t know what sparked it. A new transitory board will be formed, only keeping one member of the old one. The goal is to eventually expand it to have 9 people (instead of just 6). Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said that the company does not want any more \u0026ldquo;surprises\u0026rdquo; (understandable, given the million-dollar investment they made towards OpenAI). More updates might come in the following days (or hours), but this is the story so far.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s Chaos in Nothing Too # Nothing is a smartphone manufacturing company. It was founded in 2020 by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus. Last week, Nothing announced a new Android application - \u0026ldquo;Nothing Chats\u0026rdquo; - featuring iMessage support. User-wise, the application is simple and it allows you to send messages to iPhone users without being recognized as an Android fan. Behind the scenes, this application is \u0026ldquo;signing in on some Mac Min in a server farm somewhere\u0026rdquo;, according to Marques Brownlee. This backend part is powered by a service called Sunbird, which Nothing claimed was completely private and end-to-end encrypted.\nSpoiler alert: it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. All messages you send are logged as errors and sent as plaintext to Sunbird, which thus has access to all of them. On top of that, the messages are sent through HTTP (notice the lack of \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo;) to a Firebase cloud-syncing server which stores them as unencrypted plain text too. Text.com\u0026rsquo;s blog managed to make a successful attack and gain access to some messages and has advised all users who logged to Nothing Chats to consider their messages and password as compromised.\nAs a direct result, Nothing Chats was pulled from Google Play one day after the release and Sunbird also shut down the services \u0026ldquo;for now\u0026rdquo;, while it \u0026ldquo;investigates reports that its messages aren\u0026rsquo;t actually end-to-end encrypted\u0026rdquo; (quote from TheVerge).\nFirefox 120 Released with PIP Snapping and Privacy Options # We\u0026rsquo;ve got a new release of Firefox! Let\u0026rsquo;s talk features. Firstly, you can now do corner snapping for PIP windows. If you hold the ctrl key whilst drag-and-dropping them around you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to snap them to the corners of your screen. Secondly, there\u0026rsquo;s a new \u0026ldquo;Copy Link Without Site Tracking\u0026rdquo; option in the context menus of links, which automatically removes all useless tracking information, source tags, or other extraneous data.\nThen, there\u0026rsquo;s a new \u0026ldquo;Global Privacy Control\u0026rdquo; setting in the \u0026ldquo;Privacy \u0026amp; Security\u0026rdquo; section of Preferences. When enabled, Firefox will tell websites not to sell or share your data (this is off by default, for some weird reason). Firefox 120 also features the ability to import data from Chromium snaps, the ability to simulate browser tabs being offline in DevTools, better WebRTC audio capture on Linux, and more.\nBlueSky now has 2 million users # BlueSky, the decentralized social network with Jack Dorsey on its board of directors, has just hit 2 million registered users in its first year of life. The platform isn\u0026rsquo;t as decentralized as should be, since the actual federation part is only planned for early next year. However, a public web interface that will allow non-logged-in users to see posts as well will be released towards the end of the month.\nThis has left me wondering how the numbers compare to Mastodon. I checked, and apparently, the older decentralized social has 8 million users, out of which 1.8 million are active. And there\u0026rsquo;s some good news for them too: Flipboard has decided to stop actively monitoring or posting updates on Twitter (now X); instead, they\u0026rsquo;ll focus on Mastodon and other open social platforms.\nMeanwhile, Twitter isn\u0026rsquo;t doing well. They do have 350 million active users; however, the owner of the platform (Elon Musk) is endorsing antisemitic conspiracy theories and posting about supporting white pride. As a direct result, major advertisers (such as Apple, Disney, and IBM) halted their ad spending on the platform. The CEO, Yaccarino, said that this is only temporary and she blamed articles that she believed had been \u0026ldquo;manipulated\u0026rdquo; to damage the company.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

They have a budget of ~€11.5M in 2023 to finance the development, improvement, and maintenance of \u0026ldquo;critical open digital infrastructure\u0026rdquo;. Selected projects so far include curl, Fortran, OpenSSH, WireGuard, and - now - GNOME.\nThe GNOME Foundation has presented a clear spending plan, of which we get a peek. The funding will help design, prototype and improve a new accessibility stack, encrypt user home directories individually, modernize secret storage, invest in Quality Assurance and Developer Experience, work to expand freedesktop APIs (which will benefit other projects too), and more. If you are an individual or a non-profit who could help develop one of these goals you can get in touch with GNOME.\nThis is great news for the GNOME project; other free software organizations, such as KDE, are also working on applying for funding.\nValve Announces OLED SteamDeck # Nobody was expecting a SteamDeck upgrade, and yet here it is. This new model, which comes without any price increase, has many significant improvements. The first one is the screen: the LCD display has been swapped with a OLED one, providing more brightness and better contrast. The new display is 7.4\u0026quot; (previously 7\u0026quot;), allowing for thinner bezels around it. Oh, and it\u0026rsquo;s a 90Hz display (previously 60Hz). The battery life also received a significant upgrade (30%-50%), both thanks to a bigger battery and the less power-hungry display. We also get WiFi 6E, which offers increased bandwidth (assuming you also own a WiFi 6E modem), and a dedicated Bluetooth antenna (which translates in better connection for multiple controllers).\nOther improvements: there\u0026rsquo;s a new 2-pieces carrying case that\u0026rsquo;s a bit more compact, the device is easier to disassembly without damaging it, touchscreen responsiveness and fidelity has been improved, and the same goes for haptics feedback. The charging LED is now RGB, the Deck is ~5% lighter, and so on.\nValve has also decided to launch a \u0026ldquo;Limited Edition\u0026rdquo; version of the new Deck which features a sexy see-through shell and various components are colored red. It looks really good, but it is only available in the United States and Canada, in limited quantities.\nAs mentioned, these new devices have the same prices of the LCD models; if you\u0026rsquo;re on a budget, you can still get a previous generation model at just $399 with 256Gb onboard.\nBlender 4.0 Released # This is a major release of one of the most successful free software projects. This update comes with various significant improvements (sheen and coat layers for principled BSDF, a new view transform that provides better color handling in over-exposed areas compared to Filmic, Light linking, lots of new Nodes and Node Tools, and more). I\u0026rsquo;m no 3D artist, so - if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this new update - I would recommend hearing what\u0026rsquo;s new from the Blender announcement or its official video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/LcQkk7NbOoY?feature=oembed\nKDE Plasma 6 Apps will feature a new look # Even if you are a daily KDE user, you might be looking at the above image wondering what has changed compared to KDE Plasma 5. The change is indeed subtle, but nonetheless, it was an important step of the Breeze redesign that has been in the works for the last few years. Plasma 6 will do away with having a 1px outline around all views and will instead introduce a 1px separator between different views. This was already the case for Kirigami applications (such as Discover or System Settings), but the new look has also been ported to QWidgets (e.g. Dolphin, Gwenview, Okular). Here\u0026rsquo;s a Plasma 5.12 screenshot for comparison:\nThat\u0026rsquo;s quite a glow-up! The KDE Plasma team is also working on support for HDR games and a new sexier icons theme for Dolphin. Just last week we also got the ability to record part of the screen through Spectacle, a big redesign of the Printer settings page, a complete redesign of panel settings, faster startup times, and more.\nElementaryOS will go Wayland by default and will use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS # One month after the release of elementaryOS 7.1, Danielle Foré (Founder and CEO of the project) announced the roadmap towards the next major release of the project. We should get elementaryOS 8 in the next six months and it will be based on Ubuntu 24.04, which is a Long Term Support version and releases in April.\nOne of the most ambitious goals is to use Wayland by default, similar to other desktop environments (GNOME uses Wayland by default already, and KDE Plasma will switch to it on the next release). In order to achieve that Pantheon will need a new Dock; the existing one, Plank, is incompatible with Wayland\u0026rsquo;s security model. Hopefully, elementaryOS 8 will also complete the transition to GTK 4 that started one year ago. The next planned ports are the Captive Network Assistant, Initial Setup, and Video. System Settings is also midway through the transition.\nYou can read the entire plan for the next release here:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

Usually, these are different products with different release dates but (given how interdependent KDE 6 development is) the team has decided to release an alpha of everything on the same day (thus the name: MegaRelease).\nThis release is meant mostly for developers/testers and is expected to be highly unstable. In about a month we will also have a beta release, and we will get the official stable version towards the end of February.\nThis release is the first one built on the latest version of Qt6, but lacks some of the features in Plasma 6. However, it re-introduces the Desktop Cube effect that was removed a few versions ago and includes initial work for running HDR games. However, we will have to wait for the beta for a definitive feature list.\nFedora 39 Released with GNOME 45 # After multiple delays, Fedora 39 has been released. The Workstation build includes GNOME 45, which features the new dynamic workspace indicator, keyboard backlight toggle in Quick Settings, system info dialog in System Settings, and a new GTK look. Fedora 39 has decided to ship the new GNOME image viewer application as a replacement for Eye of GNOME. Fedora 39 brings a colored Bash prompt as well as updates to most system packages (e.g. Python 3.12, Rust 1.73, GCC 13.2, etc). We also have the very latest LibreOffice (7.6) and Firefox (119).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in trying out the release, you can find the full announcement here:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth mentioning that Fedora 40 has officially decided to ship with KDE Plasma 6 and drop X11 entirely, only offering Wayland. The release is expected to be around the end of April 2024.\nOpenAI held KeyNote and Announced GPT-4 Turbo # Artwork by The Verge, see link below.\nOpenAI held its first-ever developer conference on Monday. One of the major announcements was \u0026ldquo;GPT-4 Turbo\u0026rdquo;, which has the benefits of being ⅓ of the price of GPT-4 whilst still accepting image prompts and being able to use browsing/DALLE models to search the web and generate images. Another significant benefit is the much larger context window (a.k.a., how much text the model can \u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo;), which is now at ~300 pages of text. That\u0026rsquo;s a 4x the previous value.\nOpenAI also announced the ability to create custom versions of ChatGPT. This service is called \u0026ldquo;GPT Builder\u0026rdquo; and you will be able to add them to a store managed by OpenAI. You will only have to describe how your \u0026ldquo;GPT\u0026rdquo; should interact with the user. Of course, all of this will happen by chatting with a \u0026ldquo;GPT Builder\u0026rdquo; model.\nAnother important announcement was about the \u0026ldquo;Copyright Shield\u0026rdquo;. Apparently, OpenAI is aware that GPT models sometimes output copyrighted text, and they offered to defend their customers and pay the costs incurred if they face legal claims around copyright infringement. This seems to be thought for enterprise users.\nMozilla warns about \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; EU law that threatens Internet security # By \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; law, Mozilla means that certain articles have been reportedly agreed upon during European trialogue negotiations around the eIDAS legislation that happened behind closed-doors, meaning they are not yet publicly available.\nTo understand the threat behind those articles we require a bit of context. To enable encrypted communication, Browsers rely on Certificate Authorities. They\u0026rsquo;re entities that store, sign, and issue digital certificates. Browsers currently choose which CAs to trust. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that a malicious CA would be able to intercept all web traffic of browsers that trust them; because of that, browsers are quite careful in trusting them and they have stringent security and safety checks. It has happened in the past that some CAs misbehaved and browsers decided to remove them from the trusted list.\nThe proposed legislation, according to Mozilla, is rather simple: Article 45 of eIDAS would require browsers to always trust a list of CAs drafted by the European governments. This is particularly risky considering that lots of CAs, including some of those who previously misbehaved, are governmental entities: they\u0026rsquo;d become simultaneously the suspect, the jury, and the judge in the event of any misbehavior. Obviously, Mozilla would strongly prefer being able to vet those authorities themselves and retain the right to not trust some of them if necessary.\nYou can read more about it here:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The project is currently going through a technical transition and has also experienced an upsurge in popularity; the developers have thus decided it\u0026rsquo;s a great time to switch to a modern, chameleon-inspired design. I\u0026rsquo;m quite curious to see how this will turn out, and if you have the artistic skills to define the look of the project feel free to check the competition\u0026rsquo;s requirements and submission instructions:\nNew Linux Kernel Major Release: 6.6! # To quote Linus Torvalds\u0026rsquo;s exact wording:\nSo this last week has been pretty calm, and I have absolutely no excuses to delay the v6.6 release any more, so here it is.\nI will quickly summarize the new features; however, I will warn you that I don\u0026rsquo;t have the knowledge to understand them myself fully, so I would recommend that you also check out the in-depth article by omgubuntu. Firstly, the CFS scheduler has been replaced by a EEVDF one, which has the same role (dividing CPU time between processes) but it does so in a more efficient way; the catch is that it might lead to performance regressions on specific workloads. Memory efficiency in tracing subsystem is improved by a new eventfs subsystem, the filesystem CephFS now supports FSCRYPT, and KSMBD is no longer experimental.\nThere are improvements on the AMD front, such as the support for AMD Dynamic Boost Control, fixes for kernel panics on AMD Zen systems, support for AMD Zen 5 temperature, and AMD P-State features control via cpupower. On the Intel side of things, Linux gained support for \u0026ldquo;Intel Shadow Stack\u0026rdquo;, a hardware feature that protects applications from \u0026ldquo;return-oriented programming\u0026rdquo; attacks.\nAs mentioned above, feel free to check out the full story with more details here:\nMastodon Introduces \u0026ldquo;Lists\u0026rdquo; # And they\u0026rsquo;re pretty cool! You\u0026rsquo;ll now be able to create lists based on specific topics and interests, and the posts that fit in those categories will be automatically hidden from your home feed and shown in its own view. This \u0026ldquo;helps in decluttering your home feed but also allows you to engage with certain topics on your own terms, when you are ready\u0026rdquo;, which I feel like is a great idea especially from a \u0026ldquo;news\u0026rdquo; point of view; an user might want to have a more entertaining/positive home feed by \u0026ldquo;hiding\u0026rdquo; e.g. posts about political events in a separate view to go through at the right time.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the good news. The bad news is that, even though the feature is already available on the website, the iOS development was slowed down by some performance and crash issues, and it\u0026rsquo;s unclear when it will land.\nFedora 39 Release was Further Delayed # This is a very quick update to say that the release of Fedora 39 was delayed by a week, yet again. I\u0026rsquo;ve already covered the issues that were raised last week, and sadly three more bugs were found in the past few days; the developers have thus decided to further delay the release to the 7th of November. However, as I mentioned last time, keep in mind that this is purely a target and it might be further postponed.\nMicrosoft Wants You to Switch to Edge. Seriously. # This is a section that is meant to be a bit more fun, and it allows us to see why Free and Open Source Software is so important. The Verge has put together a great webpage that collects every single action that Microsoft has taken to push their browser Edge onto Windows users. This includes, but is not limited to: showing a poll when you download Chrome, showing a pop-up to convince people to ditch Chrome, include fake AI answers if you Bing for Chrome, forced Outlook and Teams to open all links in Edge, inserted a text to convince people to use Bing AI on Bard (Google competing service) webpage, and so on. In fact, all of this is so bad that Europe stepped in and required Microsoft to stop forcing Edge onto Windows 11 users.\nI really recommend going through the complete list, as it makes for a great laugh:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

This was quite recently implemented in KDE Plasma as well, and it\u0026rsquo;s a nice feature to see.\nFinally, we have some more technical aspects (which, to be fully honest, I do not understand). One is \u0026ldquo;support for pointer constraints\u0026rdquo;, then \u0026ldquo;DMA-BUF screen capture support\u0026rdquo; (which should improve performances with tools like OBS), and lastly \u0026ldquo;DRM leasing for VR devices\u0026rdquo; (apparently, Wayland relies on a subsystem called Direct Rendering Manager to render games on display, but VR headset required some extra support).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the full writeup, you can check it out here:\nPrivacy-focused phone Murena Two pulled $156,000 on Kickstarted # As you all know, this newsletter happily covers all kind of hardware that does not run (mainline) Linux out of the box but still offers a higher level of privacy or user respect.

Still, that sounds like a nice feature that will help users switch to Firefox.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not the only feature coming with the latest Firefox release, version 119. We also get the ability to add images to PDFs simply by drag and dropping them in the Firefox window whilst having a PDF open. This is a nice addition, given that the ability to add text and draw was recently added as well.\nFinally, Firefox is trying to make their \u0026ldquo;Firefox View\u0026rdquo; feature a bit more useful by showing an overview of tabs open in every window, recent browsing history, and all active tabs on devices synced with Firefox Sync. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this latest release, you can check out more about it here:\nA Couple of Release Dates: Fedora 39 and Plasma 6 # Fedora 39: Fedora 39 should\u0026rsquo;ve been published on the 24th of October. However, the team discovered some last-minute bugs, featuring - at the time of writing - four hard blockers, which are preventing a release. Because of that, a one-week delay was agreed upon. Futher delays might happen, but currently the goal is to publish on Halloween.\nKDE Plasma: we now have an official release date for KDE Plasma 6: the 28th of February. Some other key dates are the Alpha (November 8th), the first Beta (29 November), and the first Release Candidate (10th of January). KDE Gear (the suite of KDE applications) and the KDE Frameworks (lots of cool libraries that KDE relies upon) will also follow the same schedule.\n****Notice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The new release comes with some interesting changes, such as a completely new Flutter-based installer. On top of that, a completely new Flutter app store was also introduced. This is yet another (big!) step in Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s recently announced plan to shift its application ecosystem to Flutter, and it will be interesting to see whether it will work out or not.\nThe release also introduces TPM-backed full disk encryption, providing a more secure alternative to the previous LUKS-based encryption; even better, the ZFS file system support has been restored as an experimental feature. As always, this release upgrades all the external projects it relies on: GNOME is now version 45, the Linux kernel is version 6.5, Firefox 118, Thunderbird 115, and so on.\nThere are also some features that aren\u0026rsquo;t exclusive to Ubuntu, but that they decided to turn on by default; as an example, the Tiling Assistant GNOME extension comes enabled out of the box, allowing for simple quarter tiling.\nOf course, many Ubuntu derivatives also released their 23.10 version. We have Kubuntu shipping with KDE Plasma 5.27 and KDE Gear 23.08 (the very latest!). It also includes a Wayland session, which is \u0026ldquo;not supported\u0026rdquo; yet (as a reminder, KDE developers would like to switch to Wayland by default around February). There\u0026rsquo;s also Lubuntu 23.10 featuring LXQt 1.3, Xubuntu 23.10 featuring Xfce 4.18, and so on.\nThe next generation of Wi-Fi is here # Both title and picture taken from The Verge \u0026ndash; See link below\nAs a quick reminder, the last version of Wi-Fi was \u0026ldquo;6E\u0026rdquo; and it introduced a new 6GHz band to operate in addition to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz; Wi-Fi 7 preserves that but allows for more bandwidth, bundling across bands, and more. All of this brings up the theoretical maximum Internet speed to 5.8Gbs, mostly by allowing a maximum bandwidth of 320MHz instead of 160MHz (which is only supported on the 6GHz band). As with all of the latest updates in Wi-Fi, 7 will also be backward compatible with the previous versions.\nStackOverflow lays off 28% of staff due to AI # Since AI coding tools such as GitHub Copilot or even ChatGPT were introduced to the general public, StackOverflow has steadily lost users each month, even reaching half of the traffic compared to last year. These are rough numbers, that have made it difficult for the company to be profitable. They tried to fight against AI-generated answer on the website itself, and they announced they\u0026rsquo;d start charging companies to train on its website. They even announced their own AI, called OverflowAI, that would reply directly from the StackOverflow search bar. None of this seemed to work, as SO is now laying off one-fourth of their staff.

Firstly, there\u0026rsquo;s now an effect that allows to color-correct the monitor based on various forms of color blindness; this will allow people affected by those sight conditions to see the colors on the monitor better. Then, the F10 shortcut now opens either the main menu or the hamburger menu; this is what happens already in Microsoft Windows and GNOME, and it allows for an easier keyboard-only navigation of the applications. Finally, Kate and KWrite now come with text-to-speech functionalities: if you have QTextToSpeech installed, you have a menu option that will read the content of a file aloud.\nYou can check out the full blogpost here:\nSystem76 announces its improvements to their Thelio computers # We have some nice improvements to the Thelio line! The open hardware enclosures for Thelio received some incremental upgrades including better performance and a relocation of the front I/O ports to the top of the chassis​ (as you can see in the above photo). After launching a redesigned Thelio chassis last month, System76 unveiled new desktop options with Intel 13th Gen Core \u0026ldquo;Raptor Lake\u0026rdquo; and AMD Ryzen 7000 \u0026ldquo;Zen 4\u0026rdquo; processor options, providing more choices for those considering the System76 Thelio for their line of pre-built, Linux-focused desktops​.

Even more controversial, GNOME just proposed to (1) stop providing a x11 session and (2) remove all x11-related code.\nProposal (1) would effectively hide the \u0026ldquo;x11\u0026rdquo; button in the log-in screen; you can still get it back by manually adding a desktop file. This is just a first step that tries to be relatively uncontroversial since it\u0026rsquo;s still quite easy to get the session back; nonetheless, users have pointed out some of the missing features of Wayland and asked for more time.\nProposal (2) is much more radical, as it removes x11 support altogether. Not only would this force any GNOME user to Wayland, but it would also force all desktops and distributions relying on gnome-session to fork the project until their Wayland transition is ready. Projects like ElementaryOS or Budgie aren\u0026rsquo;t ready for this step yet, and they still rely on GNOME providing x11 support. The discussion between the GNOME developer who created the merge request and a Budgie developer got so heated that the former quite unprofessionally replied with\nBudgie isn\u0026rsquo;t the first project to use a variety of GNOME components, but it does look like it\u0026rsquo;s the only one that even after all these years still behaves like an entitled child the moment anything changes.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s still unclear is the timeline of this transition. Proposal (1) is supposed to be happening soon, but there are talks about targeting March 2025 with (2), which is hopefully enough time for a clean transition.\nLatest News in Right to Repair # I\u0026rsquo;ve got great news: after covering how a Right to Repair bill was passed in Europe, the Right to Repair Act also was signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom. This means that manufacturers must make replacement parts, software, documentation, and tools available for up to seven years after production for any device above 100$. This is a great step forward, especially since California is the home of various device manufacturers such as Apple (who, interestingly enough, decided to support the bill).\nThis might somewhat explain why Google has decided to announce seven years of software updates for their latest phone (and seven years of spare parts, too). However, The Verge points out a significant flaw in Google\u0026rsquo;s approach: they are currently limiting which of their devices get which features, even if they\u0026rsquo;re all using the same OS version. As an example, the ability to summarize recordings and advanced editing tools in Google Photo will only be available on the \u0026ldquo;Pro\u0026rdquo; version of their device. What will stop them from providing software updates to older phones, but offer them none of these new features?\nFinally, there are some device makers who seem to be independently interested in improving the reparability of their products. Take Lenovo: their executive Luca Rossi told the Canalys EMEA Forum that\nMore than 80 percent of our devices will be able to be repaired at the customer\nThis is quite interesting, especially if you consider that Lenovo has sent Frameworks (who actually builds user-reparable devices) a cease-and-desist over the design of a power button, \u0026ldquo;and then unveiled its own modular concept laptop with no promise to actually build such a thing\u0026rdquo;.\nKDE re-organizes System Settings from scratch # I\u0026rsquo;m also happy to report that, after years of discussions, the Merge Request to re-organize KDE\u0026rsquo;s System Settings has landed. This is purely about the order of the elements in the left sidebar and their categories, and it\u0026rsquo;s not 100% final; still, everybody pitched in and now every list item should be easier to find.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also worth reminding that there\u0026rsquo;s an ongoing effort in re-writing all legacy KCM (System Settings modules) to QML, making sure they\u0026rsquo;re prettier and better organised; many were ported already, so you should notice a significantly better settings application when Plasma 6 is finally released.\nFinally, KDE is also currently adding testcases to make sure the system is as stable as possible; this week, GUI tests for Battery\u0026amp;Brightness widget, Clipboard\u0026rsquo;s Widget, and System Settings Users page were introduced.\nOldTechBloke has passed away due to lung cancer # OldTechBloke (Steve Anelay) was a Linux Youtuber active up until 8 months ago; he had decided to take a break due to deteriorating health conditions. We only recently discovered that he died peacefully on Sunday 24th of September. His passion for Linux and his contributions to the community will always be remembered and cherished by his viewers and fellow enthusiasts.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

He released he is undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma; he says the prognosis is good and hopes to continue to be active in the GNU community for years to come. He wore a medical mask at the event and asked the audience to wear one too, only lowering his to show that his characteristic beard was gone too. There\u0026rsquo;s not much more to say about it, Stallman is widely known in the Free Software community, and I can only hope for a full recovery.\nPlasma 6 gains new Overview, Camera indicator, and floating panels by default # Every week Nate Graham, KDE developer, publishes a nice blogpost that shares some insight on the development of Plasma; this week\u0026rsquo;s is particularly juicy! I\u0026rsquo;m also proud to share that a couple of major features highlighted here were developed by me.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s new? Firstly, the Overview and Desktop Grid effects were completely re-written from scratch and feature a new look that\u0026rsquo;s much more similar to GNOME\u0026rsquo;s; this also improves the gestures significantly, merging the two effects together (e.g. meaning you can cycle between overview and grid view with a shortcut), and the top desktop bar will switch to be a left column if you have a vertical desktops setup. By the way, there\u0026rsquo;s also work ongoing (not merged yet) to implement 2D gestures; this means e.g. moving your fingers on the touchpad up/down will activate the overview, and left/right will switch between desktops, at the same time (a bit like the bottom handle on iOS!).\nOther significant features: similar to GNOME, Plasma also has a camera indicator applet that will appear in your system tray whenever you are being recorded. Clicking on it will show all the cameras in use, if there\u0026rsquo;s more than one. Lastly, floating panels were significantly re-factored: they now have shadows behind them, they don\u0026rsquo;t have ugly margins around them when they de-float anymore, and applets opened from a floating panel will be floating too. With this refactor, KDE Plasma now uses floating panels by default!\nCOSMIC desktop update: Window Snapping mode! # We also get our monthly update on the development of another desktop: COSMIC! We seem to be getting closer to a full release, since all the team is using it daily. The first big new is called \u0026ldquo;Swap mode\u0026rdquo;; we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in past newsletters how Pop!_OS includes Auto-tiling, and pressing Super+X whilst tiled will enable this \u0026ldquo;window snapping mode\u0026rdquo;. You can then use arrows to select another window on the screen, and that window will be swapped with the active one. Cool!\nThis month we also get text inputs, search fields and inline inputs. A lot of work was made to make sure the size and color of the above elements are consistent with the theme and user settings. We also get \u0026ldquo;Dynamic settings\u0026rdquo; a.k.a. settings you don\u0026rsquo;t have to click apply, but rather they\u0026rsquo;ll apply instantly. This required changes in the compositor, which also gained the ability to handle pointer gestures such as pinch-to-zoom.\nAfter featuring its mockup for months, the system settings page for panel and dock was finally implemented too! We\u0026rsquo;ve seen that they can be set to light and dark mode, you can adjust size or opacity, margins, auto-hide, and so on. You can also customize the applets in each panel.\nThe Arc browser introduces AI in quite an original way # Arc is a quite interesting MacOS-only proprietary browser that tries to redefine entirely how the web should be navigated; even though this might not be that relevant to an audience of Free Software fans - I don\u0026rsquo;t even have a Mac device to try it! - Arc is introducing some AI features that might be also integrated into other browsers soon, and they\u0026rsquo;re worth talking about. So, let\u0026rsquo;s get to it.\nWhenever you pin a tab in Arc, the title of the tab will be given to a LMM which will give it a shorter and more descriptive name. Same goes with downloads: instead of \u0026ldquo;3776x_L.jpg\u0026rdquo;, Arc will automatically rename the file with something more meaningful.\nIf you hover a link and hold down Shift, a popup will appear with the summary of a page and a preview.\nWhen you search some text in a page and there are no matches, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to give the query directly to the AI, which will read the page content to answer. This means you can query the page directly for information.\nWhat I really admire of these features is that none of them really screams \u0026ldquo;AI\u0026rdquo; (or, as it often happens lately, \u0026ldquo;I implemented AI just to have it, without really integrating it\u0026rdquo;). Instead, I can easily see myself using those features, and they all address some usecase. I particularly appreciate, as an example, the browser automatically keeping the download folder filenames descriptive. Arc did try a much heavier approach to AI, where all the interaction was through a chat-like experience, but eventually found that this was the most effective way to integrate AI.\nOther browsers are trying similar approaches: SignaOS browser launched \u0026ldquo;Airis\u0026rdquo;, Opera has \u0026ldquo;Aria\u0026rdquo;, and Chrome and Edge seem to want to implement similar features soon. So: is this the right way to do AI? Yay or nay?\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The 45 release contains a lot of visual changes that had been teased at GUADEC, and some more. Firstly, we have the new activities dots indicator officially replacing the \u0026ldquo;Activities\u0026rdquo; label; this indicator represents all desktops as little dots, and the current one is a bigger pill. Clicking on them will access the usual overview.\nStill on the top bar, we also now have a camera indicator that pops up whenever any application is recording you (a big privacy improvement that KDE developers are rushing to introduce too). Finally, you can now open and close the quick settings through the Super+S keyboard shortcut.\nSearch also saw many improvements; the redesign that GNOME is working on are still to be released, but we do get major performance improvements to a range of applications (Software, Clocks, Files, Calculator, \u0026hellip;) when they display search results.\nAs I previously mentioned here, GNOME 45 has a brand new image viewer application; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;fast and clean\u0026rdquo;, fully adaptive and works on mobile phones too. It can be used with touchscreen and touchpad gestures too (two finger swipes to switch between images, pinch to zoom in/out, and rotation is also supported).\nThe camera application also finished the incubation process and is now shipped out-of-the box. You can take still images or videos and you can review them directly within the application.\nOther changes are all about the introduction of new standard (libadwaita) components that were picked up by core applications; this ensures that any new design change is consistent throughout the GNOME suite. And, wow, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to like! The sidebar component now spans the entire height of the window! I was not aware this was planned, and it simply looks gorgeous. Great job, GNOME!\nOf course, there\u0026rsquo;s so much more to talk about; this is what GNOME developers have been working on for months. All of that won\u0026rsquo;t fit in this newsletter, so feel free to check the full release announcement here:\nMozilla creates a new AI startup, invests $30M # In the world of Open Source, $30M is no small sum. Just to give you a rough idea of the size of this investment, it\u0026rsquo;s the total donations that Thunderbird receives in 5 years, or that KDE receives in 150 years. It\u0026rsquo;s thus fair to ask: what\u0026rsquo;s this new mozilla.ai, and how will that sum be spent?\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have much information at all, right now. Firstly, Mozilla wants to help create a more ethical and safe approach to AI. The exact issues that this new startup wants to address - and how - are rather unclear. Recommendation systems seem to be a big part of it, but the blogpost simply says:\nWe’ll share more on these — and what we’re building — in the coming months.\nSo, is that a good idea? Should Mozilla invest in \u0026ldquo;ethical\u0026rdquo; AI? I don\u0026rsquo;t have an answer, but you can read the announcement and judge it yourself:\nHowever, I do want to point out that this probably won\u0026rsquo;t lessen the focus of Mozilla on its major product, Firefox. In fact, we saw a new release (118) just yesterday, finally featuring automatic translation. There\u0026rsquo;s a new button in the address bar that you can click to translate the entire webpage content to your language. Other major features include: the ability to print documents on Android, ten new math CSS functions for developers, and a new math library that makes it harder for websites to fingerprint you.\nA leak shows that Microsoft would like to buy Valve # Of course, \u0026ldquo;would like to buy\u0026rdquo; is worthless if Valve does not want to be acquired by Microsoft; however, I agree with the message that Liam Dawe, author of GamingOnLinux, decided to publish along with this information:\nMicrosoft, don\u0026rsquo;t you dare touch Valve.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to talk about this. A few days ago, an article titled \u0026ldquo;Valve Is A Wonderful Upstream Contributor To Linux \u0026amp; The Open-Source Community\u0026rdquo; explained why. Valve has either worked on or sponsored work - through companies like Igalia and Blue Systems - on Mesa OpenGL and Vulkan drivers, the kernel graphics driver components, the KDE Plasma desktop and applications, and so on. On top of that, Valve has developed Proton which (thanks to Wine) allows gamers to play a great amount of games directly on Linux devices. Finally, they have produced the most popular Linux device ever (the SteamDeck), which allows anyone to switch to Linux just by pressing the power button.\nWould a Microsoft-owned Valve do the same? I doubt it.\nThis section would be seriously lacking if I didn\u0026rsquo;t include a major announcement from Valve just a few days ago: a new release of SteamVR is now available, with a major UI overhaul. A new VR device is rumored to be in the works: maybe this is what\u0026rsquo;s next for the company?\nKDE wants to make it easier to pay developers for bugs \u0026amp; features # The latest blogpost from KDE developer Nate Graham explains a bit about how funding developers work in the KDE world. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned already how Valve sponsors some developers, and other companies do the same too. KDE itself currently employs a couple of developers and other contractors (e.g. promotion, documentation, and legal stuff people). However, KDE would like to make it easier for users to directly sponsor small amounts of work; ideally, this would make it possible for more people to work on KDE, even if they\u0026rsquo;re not employed.\nSo, hear me out, KDE users: is there anything that annoys you? Would you be willing to throw some money at it? If so, check out\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

Even better, there\u0026rsquo;s a great community of third-party applications. So, what\u0026rsquo;s new?\nOne big announcement is the Nextcloud Assistant; this is a large language model that interacts with Nextcloud, but only works locally. This means that it does not send any of your private data to anyone (especially not OpenAI, like GPT-based systems). This Assistant can summarize, re-write, and translate text in your notes; it\u0026rsquo;s integrated into e-mails too, meaning you can also summarize entire threads in one click. In Nextcloud Talk (video meeting / chat application) you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to ask questions during conversations in a ChatGPT-like manner. Again, all of this happens locally and no data is shared.\nBut this version comes with \u0026ldquo;healthy meeting culture\u0026rdquo; features too, including the ability to turn off notifications during certain times of the day, snooze emails for a certain amount of time, and warn you if the call is going on for too long. Nextcloud Talk will even display the total talking time of each participant in a call.

Funnily enough, just two hours before that announcement Godot released a new funding system, which you can find here. The goal was to get - roughly - €30k/month to pay the current developers, and ideally some more to hire new ones.\nThe goal was met within a week and we\u0026rsquo;re almost at €50k/month; the game engine received a lot of attention from last week\u0026rsquo;s Unity controversy, which surely helped. In fact, some major game publishers decided to drop big recurring or one-time donations to the game engine as a direct result of Unity\u0026rsquo;s announcement. An example of that is Re-Logic, the makers of Terraria, who donated $100k to Godot and will keep donating $1k/month going forward. They say:\nWe unequivocally condemn and reject the recent TOS/fee changes proposed by Unity and the underhanded way they were rolled out. The flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers is the saddest part. That this move was wholly unnecessary pushes things into the tragedy category - a cautionary tale the industry will not soon forget.\nFedora 40 to drop X11 entirely # In the last week or so, two wild Fedora 40 proposals appeared; the first one was about dropping x11 for the KDE Plasma variant, and the second one was about dropping it for the GNOME version as well.\nAs you can imagine, this created significant controversy. Even though developers consider Wayland the future, not everyone can enjoy that future yet. Many users whose use cases aren\u0026rsquo;t covered by Wayland complained, such as David Revoy, one of the most famous open-source artists:\nA distro without colour management and that super limited tablet support screams to all artists, graphists and designers that they are no longer welcome in this community.\nIn the same thread, you can see Neal Gompa, who\u0026rsquo;s very active in the Fedora project, address the criticism; if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this topic, it\u0026rsquo;s also interesting to read Nate Graham\u0026rsquo;s (KDE developer) article that was written as a result of that discussion:\nI\u0026rsquo;ll quote one of the final paragraphs:\nFedora has always been a “leading edge” distro that pushes forward the technical state of the art on Linux by adopting new technology once it’s mostly ready, thus causing it rapidly improve in a way that it otherwise would not have. Fedora was the first distro to adopt Systemd, PulseAudio, and PipeWire. It was the first to use the Plasma Wayland session by default. And now Fedora KDE wants to be the first to drop the Plasma X11 session entirely and make everyone use the Plasma Wayland session.\nOf course, it\u0026rsquo;s not certain that the proposal will actually go through, even though it seems likely. The release of Fedora 40 should be around April next year. Since Plasma 6 will be released in February, it seems like this version will also include the very latest major KDE release.\nFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that the XFCE project recently updated its roadmap for Wayland support. This includes choices like dropping XWayland, and using wlroots instead of libmutter as the compositor library. Some desktop components - such as the panel - have already been ported to Wayland. However, the official position on the obvious question \u0026ldquo;When will Wayland XFCE be ready?\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound great:\nIt is not clear yet which Xfce release will target a complete Xfce Wayland transition (or if such a transition will happen at all).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one more thing\u0026hellip; # This is not particularly relevant, but it\u0026rsquo;s still worth a laugh: did you know that Windows 11 has a CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + WIN + L keyboard shortcut? I find it quite funny already that such a weird shortcut exists, to be honest. Still, try to guess what it does.\nNope, you\u0026rsquo;re wrong. The correct answer is: it opens LinkedIn.

Unity has recently announced a new pricing plan which - I think - is both a great example of why relying on proprietary platforms is a considerable risk, and an excellent occasion for open-source alternatives like Godot to become more mainstream.\nThe new pricing plan includes a pay-per-download pricing scheme. The rates go from 20 cents per install (Unity Personal / Unity Plus) to 1 cent per install (Unity Enterprise). Even if this sounds reasonable to you, there\u0026rsquo;s a big, big issue.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Unity who has the responsibility to count the number of installs. When asked by users how that would happen, Unity replied that the system is proprietary and they would prefer not to disclose details about it; that is, we should blindly trust Unity on how much we own them. To make this even worse, Unity said that this proprietary system is unable to distinguish between a fresh install and a re-install. If the user installs, uninstalls, and re-installs the game, developers will pay the fee two times. Obviously, this means that malicious actors might purposefully re-install games multiple times as a form of protest. Even worse, installing the game on multiple devices (e.g. your computer and your handheld) will also count as two separate installs. Finally, \u0026ldquo;install\u0026rdquo; - as defined by Unity - includes \u0026ldquo;distribution via streaming or web browser\u0026rdquo;. If you embed your Unity game in a web page, you will be charged for each user that will simply access that page.\nAll of this was done unilaterally, without any prior warning. By coincidence, the very same day Godot announced their new Development Fund. This allows you - or your company - to donate directly to the project; the donations will then be used to hire new developers. This fund already reached 27,710€/month.\nNew EU rules for smartphone repairability, by Right to Repair # Right to Repair, a movement very close to the Free \u0026amp; Open Source values, published a blog post covering the new EU Ecodesign and Energy Labelling rules on mobile phones and tablets. These will make smartphones easier to repair and more durable and will come into effect in June 2025. These two paragraphs are concise enough that I can just quote them:\nThese regulations will empower independent repairers and end-users by ensuring access to spare parts and to the information necessary to repair for at least 7 years after the end of the distribution of a product in the market. Additionally, manufacturers will have to make compatible software updates available for at least 5 years.\nOn reliability, smartphones will have to withstand at least 45 accidental drops without functional impairment and maintain at least 80% of their battery capacity after undergoing 800 charging cycles. Tablets are to follow the same rules, but only for their battery capacity.\nOn top of that, Right to Repair nicely explains what changes are still required, and the shortcomings of the above ruling. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this cause, I would suggest giving the full article a read:\nMozilla claims cars are the worst product category for Privacy # The \u0026ldquo;Privacy Not Included\u0026rdquo; blog, hosted by Mozilla, analyzes various products to see how well they respect your privacy. Just last week a blog post about car software was published, and the situation seems to be really bad. Firstly, here\u0026rsquo;s a list of data that car manufacturers can collect:\nThe gist is: they can collect super intimate information about you \u0026ndash; from your medical information, your genetic information, to your “sex life” (seriously), to how fast you drive, where you drive, and what songs you play in your car \u0026ndash; in huge quantities.\nNow, the claim that cars collect your \u0026ldquo;sex life\u0026rdquo; sounds\u0026hellip; weird. Investigating, this seems to come from this Nissan webpage. Indeed, we see that both Sexual Orientation and Sexual Activity can be collected according to that privacy policy; however, they can only be collected by \u0026ldquo;Direct contact with users and Nissan employees\u0026rdquo;. The data is collected for \u0026ldquo;internal reporting and analytics purposes\u0026rdquo; and will be shared with business partners. So, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s bad.\nOn top of that, 84% of the brands they tested will sell your data, and 56% will also share it with the government in response to even an informal request. This sounds pretty dangerous, considering that cars collect your position.\nIf this interested you, I suggest that you peek over the full report:\nThe Internet Archive will appeal in the Hachette v. Internet Archive lawsuit # Necessary context: the Internet Archive has an Open Library program, later expanded with the National Emergency Library Initiative. This allows users to digitally lend e-books for a certain period of time, including many under copyright. They were immediately sued by four publishers who claimed that both systems (Open Library \u0026amp; NEL) were “willful digital piracy on an industrial scale”; they won in March, and in August the Internet Archive was asked to take down the copyrighted books.\nThe Internet Archive has decided to appeal this decision. It won\u0026rsquo;t be an easy battle, though: Chris Freeland - the director of library services - said:\nAs we stated when the decision was handed down in March, we believe the lower court made errors in facts and law, so we are fighting on in the face of great challenges. We know this won’t be easy, but it’s a necessary fight if we want library collections to survive in the digital age.\nAgain, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested, you can check out the full article here:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The first issue is pushing users into Edge; currently, Windows 11 opens its own browser if you click the Windows Widgets panel or any search result, completely ignoring the default browser selection. This violates some EU regulations, as the test builds in the development channel will now use the preferred browser to open those links\u0026hellip; as long as you like in the European Economic Area. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that this happened due to the EU Digital Markets Act, which will come into effect in March 2024. You can read more about this here:\nBut of course, it\u0026rsquo;s not just that. On top of this, Microsoft has decided to unbundle the Teams application from the Microsoft 365 suite\u0026hellip; but only for EU markets, starting in October. Why\u0026rsquo;s that? Well, we can only guess, but the European Commission did open a formal antitrust investigation regarding Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s bundling of Teams in the Office productivity suite. Interestingly enough, the price of Microsoft 365 will be updated to reflect that, as you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to purchase a 365 subscription without Teams: it\u0026rsquo;s 2€/month less. Unsurprisingly, prices are in euros.

As always, there\u0026rsquo;s not much to say about this news: it\u0026rsquo;s just a new wallpaper. However, I do have to point out that the above maze that takes the shape of a minotaur is actually a maze you can go ahead and solve; just make sure to use Ariadne\u0026rsquo;s thread to get out.\nOMGUbuntu\u0026rsquo;s coverage of this also quickly mentions the difference between mazes and labyrinths, check it out:\nHeads up: GNOME 45 might break your extensions # GNOME 45 will make use of ECMAScript Modules (ESM) instead of GJS as the primary mechanisms for managing the extensions\u0026rsquo; code. This has many benefits (ECMAScript 6 is the industry standard) but raises concerns about the compatibility of extensions. If you own one, you should immediately test it on GNOME\u0026rsquo;s beta to make sure it works; and if it does not, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to publish a separate build for GNOME 45 (which won\u0026rsquo;t work on GNOME 44 and previous versions).\nNitrux 3.0 - codenamed \u0026ldquo;Ut\u0026rdquo; - has been released # As a quick recap if you missed a previous episode: Nitrux is a distribution based on KDE Plasma which features its own set of applications - called Maui - and is even beginning to test out a custom-made \u0026ldquo;Maui\u0026rdquo; shell. It\u0026rsquo;s meant to be immutable and uses appimages and distrobox to install packages.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s new? Firstly, it uses the very latest version of both KDE Plasma (5.27.7) and KDE Frameworks (5.108); these are the last minor versions of the 5 series, and they\u0026rsquo;ll be the best KDE has to offer for quite some time. Firefox has also been updated to v117 and KWallet is now automatically unlocked at login. Of course, all the Maui applications have been updated as well and they use the latest version of the KDE-based \u0026ldquo;Mauikit\u0026rdquo; application toolkit. Interestingly enough, MauiShell is not mentioned in this release, which still uses Plasma as the main desktop.\nCutefishOS is back with a new Debian 12 release # CutefishOS is (was?) an ambitious project to create a new distribution with its own modern-looking desktop environment. A bit too ambitious maybe, as the project was discontinued last year and - later on - the team was considering resuming the work under a different name.\nWe now have a new beta release; it is based on Debian 12 \u0026ldquo;Bookworm\u0026rdquo; and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. However, it looks like this is coming from a single developer, who also decided to change the name to \u0026ldquo;CutefishOS Reborn\u0026rdquo;. Can the project survive with such a limited workforce? I find it unlikely, but only time will tell.\nWhilst we wait, debugpointnews has published a nice review of the beta, which also describes the CutefishOS look as a whole:\nBudgie released version 10.8 with updated applets # Lots of updates from interesting projects this week! So, what\u0026rsquo;s new here? Firstly, there\u0026rsquo;s a new trash applet. The widget existed already as a third party item, but it was upstreamed and now it\u0026rsquo;s included by default for all Budgie users to add to their panels. The Battery Status applet can now switch between Balanced / Power Saver / Performance modes (provided that your system supports that). The System Tray applet uses the modern Status Notifier specification, and the Budgie Menu also has had a menu category reorganization to be more clear.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the full list (with screenshots!), you can check it out here: Notice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

One highlight of this release is the introduction of the \u0026ldquo;Merkuro\u0026rdquo; application suite, which will - soon - have Calendar, To-Dos, Contacts, and E-Mails covered. Merkuro is actually the re-branding of the Kalendar application, which developed so quickly that it had to split into multiple applications.\nOf course, there\u0026rsquo;s more. Skanpage, KDE\u0026rsquo;s scanning utility, now lets you change the order of scanned pages through simple drag-and-drop and allows you to quickly change brightness, contrast, gamma, and color balance. NeoChat, KDE\u0026rsquo;s Matrix client, now has a map that allows you to see all users currently broadcasting their position (\u0026ldquo;great to see where your friends are!\u0026rdquo;). Tokodon, KDE\u0026rsquo;s Mastodon client, has received many visual improvements (such as support for trending tags) and now allows instance owners to moderate directly from the application itself.\nThis release also contains an update to Kdenlive, KDE\u0026rsquo;s video editor, which has new effects (Audio Seam and Audio Fade) to hide the audio cracks that can be heard when cutting mkv files.\nKWordQuiz, a flashcard-based educational application, has been pretty much rewritten from scratch in QML. Believe me: the design is miles ahead of the previous version. Of course, all of these changes were only a limited selection of the most interesting things, and you can instead go through the full list:\nKdenlive has its own changelog here:\nFairphone announces the fifth version of its phone # Similarly to Frameworks, Fairphone isn\u0026rsquo;t directly connected to the Linux world; however, the company has values that are very close to our community\u0026rsquo;s, and it shows: Fairphones have historically had great support for clean Android installs and even full Linux mobile distributions. If you care about open-source, you probably want Fairphone to succeed!\nGood news, then: Fairphone has just launched the fifth iteration of their phone. The device is extremely modular, as you can see above, and most components can be replaced even by inexperienced users. On top of that, the materials of the phone are ethically sourced, there\u0026rsquo;s an amazing 5-year warranty, and Fairphone would like to offer support until 2033 - ten years from now. That\u0026rsquo;s not insane: the company just recently stopped supporting the 2015 Fairphone 2, seven years after release.\nThe specs are also significantly better compared to the previous versions: it has a 90hz OLED screen, dual 50-megapixel cameras, 30W fast charging, and more. Of course, all of this doesn\u0026rsquo;t come for cheap: the starting price in Europe is 699€.\nVanillaOS releases the developer version of Orchid # VanillaOS is an extremely promising immutable distribution; the team has been working on the 2 (codenamed Orchid) version for quite a while, and they\u0026rsquo;re now ready to share alpha builds. So, very quickly, what changed?\nFirstly, the project got rid of the Ubuntu base and instead decided to switch to Debian. This is to have complete control over the release cycle and avoid the work of removing all Ubuntu packages that they did not want to be in the release. In fact, the Debian base is modular (and could technically be swapped out). The Vanilla changes are applied on top, and everything is built using VIB images (Vanilla Image Builder). In fact, all images follow OCI (Open Container Initiative) specs, which makes them quite easy to swap out if you need more customization or want to work on derivatives.\nThis comes with a lot of other changes under the hood; I\u0026rsquo;ve covered them in past newsletters, and they are all about immutability: instead of installing applications in the root partition - as one normally would - Vanilla gives you the option to have a \u0026ldquo;virtual\u0026rdquo; sub-system which exposes the installed packages as if they were actually installed; but, of course, you can rollback those sub-systems anytime and they\u0026rsquo;re never able to compromise the stability of the system itself.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning more about the project, check this blogpost out:\nFirefox 117 released, and some depressing facts # Good news: Mozilla has just released Firefox 117, which brings some nice features. The major one should\u0026rsquo;ve been playing catch-up to other browsers: Firefox could translate foreign pages automatically. The translation would\u0026rsquo;ve been all done locally, which is significantly better for your privacy compared to - as an example - what Chrome does. However, this feature that was in the beta release apparently did not make it into the final release; most likely, it needs some further work and polishing and will be part of the next version. Also, Firefox 117 removes the floating screen recording indicator when using Wayland: apparently, it never worked too well on other platforms as well, and they decided to remove it in favor of OS-specific indicators.\nHowever, Firefox 117 now supports copy and paste of images in Android, there\u0026rsquo;s improved CSS nesting by default, and it\u0026rsquo;s possible to disable the context menu when pressing Shift+right-click. You can read more about it here:\nBad news, though: according to FOSSpost, Firefox has lost 70 million users in the last five years. Now it has roughly 176 million users, meaning that - at this rate - Firefox won\u0026rsquo;t be used by anybody in just over ten years. Of course, these linear extrapolations are not actually of any use in forecasting the future, but they still help to visualize just how bad the situation for Firefox currently is. Let\u0026rsquo;s keep in mind that, currently, Firefox is the only open-source web browser with its own rendering engine, Gecko, instead of just using Chromium.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

Well, under the \u0026ldquo;Format\u0026rdquo; menubar item you now have a \u0026ldquo;Theme\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; button which will open the above dialog. By selecting a different theme, all main elements (title, subtitle, headings, etc.) will be re-colored based on the theme values. If you are unsure which element you\u0026rsquo;re working with (you also have index heading, subtitles, list contents, senders, signatures, etc.) LibreOffice also added a \u0026ldquo;Spotlight\u0026rdquo; button that shows the ID of each element type directly in the document itself.\nOn top of that, we also have support for zoom gestures when using touchpads in the main view (a very welcome improvement!) and a new page number wizard to custom-insert a page number on the header/footer of each page. Of course, the LibreOffice suite includes many applications and the changelog is thus quite long; if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the more specific change for certain applications in the suite, you can see the full list here:\nKDE Plasma changes one of its most controversial features # KDE Plasma is one of the few desktops which defaults to \u0026ldquo;single click to open file/folders\u0026rdquo;. I should say \u0026ldquo;was\u0026rdquo;, given that the default has just been changed to the more standard \u0026ldquo;single click to select file/folders, double click to open\u0026rdquo;. This is quite a controversial change! many KDE developers and users have strongly advocated for one or the other option since years and years ago.\nEventually, the tipping point was simple: most Plasma-based distributions were changing KDE\u0026rsquo;s own default to \u0026ldquo;double click to open\u0026rdquo;. The words of KDE developers Nate are: the decision has already been taken for us [by those distributions].\nHowever, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only big change we saw last week. A search field was also introduced to all settings windows of QtWidgets applications (such as Dolphin, Gwenview, etc).

Firstly, this event aligns with another, called The Freeze. This includes UI, feature and API freezes (meaning that no new feature, UI/API change can be added in GNOME 45). This is required (a) for developers to polish the experience before the release (b) for third party developers to test extensions and applications on the latest version and (c) to have enough time to prepare promotional material for the release.\nOf course, beta releases are meant for GNOME developers and beta testers, not for the general public. Because of that, the installer image is really only meant to be installed in a virtual machine. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s a 45beta branch of the flatpak runtimes to test out the beta versions of Flathub applications.

We are receiving monthly updates on the work-in-progress, and the latest news goes in-depth about the customization options; in fact, it states that theming was a main focus for COSMIC.\nWe are getting an \u0026ldquo;Appearance\u0026rdquo; page in System Settings. This will allow switching between light and dark themes, and the system can also select the theme automatically depending on the time of day. We do also get the ability to pick an accent color (either from a selected list, or a color picker).\nThen, the user is asked for four colors: application background, primary container background, interface text palette tint, and neutral palette tint. These are used as a basis to generate the entire colorscheme; as an example, you can see in the screenshot above an interface generated using a brown-ish neutral tint. The generation is done by switching all colors from RGB to OKLCH and manipulating color lightness whilst preserving chroma and hue.\nThis approach has many benefits compared to what other desktops do; as an example, GNOME does not provide any kind of colorscheme functionality out of the box; KDE Plasma does, but in order to create a new color theme you have to change the color for each element. Instead, COSMIC\u0026rsquo;s approach is much easier, but still much more powerful than no option at all.\nYou will be able to select a corner radii value from three possible styles, and the spacing between elements is also customizable through a \u0026ldquo;density\u0026rdquo; setting. These, if implemented, would be quite unique settings to this desktop.

This is the fourth wallpaper contest hosted by KDE recently, and it aims at providing wallpaper for Plasma 6. Anyone can participate and the deadline is the 14th of November.\nThe guidelines say that the wallpaper must be original, created for the contest, and released under the CC-BY-SA license. AI art submissions won\u0026rsquo;t be accepted, even if just for the copyright requirement. The images should be at least 3k and each artist can submit up to three wallpapers.\nThe jury will be made up of contributors to the KDE Visual Design group, and they will select six finalists at the end of the competition. The finalists will be provided with feedback directly from the judges and they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to update their wallpapers accordingly. When this is done, the best wallpaper will be selected and the author will receive the Frameworks Laptop.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning more, you can check out the full announcement here:\nGNOME has a brand-new Image Viewer # A better way to phrase it would be: the Loupe image viewer has been added to the set of core GNOME applications as the out-of-the-box default for GNOME 45. This is a great achievement for GNOME and something that was in progress for the last few months.\nAt the same time, the application got a couple of new features. Firstly, the engine that loads the images - glycin - is now fully sandboxed, even for SVG files. Secondly, the print dialog - which you can see in the screenshot above - was completely redesigned.\nThis week in GNOME we also saw the release of GTK 4.12. This included new and improved components to developers of GTK-based applications and the support for the Vulkan renderer. The support is still marked as experimental, but the team says that it\u0026rsquo;s now much \u0026ldquo;less of a science project\u0026rdquo;.\nA vector layer was also introduced to the Map application (though this is experimental as well). Showing the map through vectors instead of as an image would allow for custom styling (e.g. applying GNOME light/dark style sheets) and using the GNOME theme icons for places.\nGenerally speaking, the release of GNOME 45 is getting closer and closer and under-the-hood projects (such as GJS, which allows usage of GNOME libraries in JavaScript) are releasing betas with various bugfixes and performance improvements. You can read the full update here:\nThe Linus Media Group is being heavily criticized # Though this is not directly related to the Linux world, LTT is probably one of the biggest tech content creator out there and the controversy that recently sparked gained a lot of traction; thus, I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth summarizing what happened.\nThe outrage started when the above video, by Gamers Nexus, was published. The video highlight significant issues in the management of the Linus Media Group (which includes Linus Tech Tips and secondary channels such as ShortCircuit). As an example, the video points out that the LMG multiple times failed to spend the necessary time on reviews of products, producing videos with significant flaws and refusing - when called out - to remove the video or properly address the mistake.\nThe single incident that gained most traction is regarding Billet Labs. The company (made of two people) sent LMG a engineering sample of one of their cooling devices along with a supported GPU to test it with. The LMG lost the provided GPU, and thus decided to test the cooler with an unsupported graphics card. Instructions and context on the cooler was also provided by Billet Labs, and completely ignored in LTT\u0026rsquo;s video. Linus portrayed the cooler in a quite negative light and, when asked why he didn\u0026rsquo;t test with a supported GPU, replied that it did not matter: even if the cooler had worked - he said - it still would\u0026rsquo;ve been a terrible product. He added that he did not want to spend the extra $100/500 required to re-shoot with the correct GPU.\nBilliet Labs then asked the cooler to be returned, as it was an engineering sample they have in very limited quantity. LMG agreed to that, twice. However, the cooler was instead auctioned and sold. Billiet Labs was then ignored, until two hours after the above video was published. Only then Linus offered them a refund of the cost of the product.\nThis was just a quick summary, and the situation is still evolving. Here\u0026rsquo;s the video that was uploaded in response:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

On top of that, refurbished Steam Decks will also start appearing in Game Stops, though those will be refurbished by the Game Stops themselves and will only be available to Game Stop Pro subscribers. Refurbished supplies are limited, so Valve expects them to go out of stock frequently.\nAs always, the Decks feature Linux and are developed in (indirect) partnership with KDE; if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in an open-source-friendly handheld, this might be a great time to buy one.\nThe BBC joined the Fediverse (as an experiment) # The BBC decided to create its own Mastodon instance (social.bbc) to host its social media accounts, like BBC R\u0026amp;D, Radio 4, and 5 Live.

Even cooler, the BBC announcement gives a bit of insight into the reasoning behind the choice, including its challenges.\nAs an example, they\u0026rsquo;ve decided not to allow users to register in their Mastodon instance.

This means they do have to moderate the replies themselves, something that\u0026rsquo;s usually mostly handled by the social network itself.\nThis is an experiment that will run for six months. Then, they\u0026rsquo;ll decide whether to continue or not. I quite appreciate how transparent they are in this phase: they don\u0026rsquo;t know if reaching a wider audience will be worth maintaining and moderating the instance, they are worried about the lack of centralized rules or filters, and so on; they just say, \u0026ldquo;we are learning as we go\u0026rdquo;. First stable version of Rhino Linux released # You might remember Rolling Rhino, a rolling (a.k.a. continuous stream of updates) version of Ubuntu. You might not know that Rolling Rhino was discontinued just last year, teasing a new project called Rhino Linux.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s this \u0026ldquo;Rhino Linux\u0026rdquo;? It\u0026rsquo;s a rolling distribution, based on Ubuntu, using the Unicorn desktop. It\u0026rsquo;s made by the same developers as Rolling Rhino, and it has just been released as stable. For that out-of-the-loop, Ubuntu only releases two major releases a year containing all the upgrades in the past six months; a rolling distribution, instead, has no major releases and has a constant stream of updates.\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s this \u0026ldquo;Unicorn\u0026rdquo; desktop? It\u0026rsquo;s a derivative of XFCE. It comes out of the box with ULauncher, a lightweight Linux launcher. They\u0026rsquo;ve also customized the default look - as you can see in the above screenshot - and included the app grid applet. The dock is not XFCE\u0026rsquo;s, but Plank.\nIf all of this sound interesting to you, check out the project here:\nA summary of GNOME, KDE, and Elementary updates # This week, we happen to have a lot of smaller but interesting updates from these three projects, so I will try my best to quickly tell you about what you should know.\nOn the KDE side of things, Plasma 6 is progressing fast; even cooler, core developer David Edmunson has published a blogpost with new functionalities he implemented (but that are not part of Plasma yet). If everything goes well and those features actually get included, you will be able to:\nPress and hold a key to see accents alternatives, like on a phone keyboard;\nInsert a live transcription of your voice in any text field using Whisper;\nInsert any emoji simply by typing \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; and the emoji name;\nType in any text field in a language, and have KDE automatically translate the text in a different language;\nand more! It\u0026rsquo;s easy to see how this experiment with input methods is quite exciting. You can check it out, with videos, here:\nhttp://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/new-ideas-using-wayland-input-methods/\nOn the GNOME side of things, GNOME Shell and Mutter 45 have been released as betas, if you want to try them out before the official release. Also, multiple blogposts describe how the Nighly version of Sysprof is helping GNOME developers to reduce the runtime and startup times of a lot of GNOME search providers (the components which populate the search results of the shell). Also, Workbench - GNOME\u0026rsquo;s prototyping application - is now able to load and save on-disk projects; this is a great tool to test out small snippets of code and learn about GNOME technologies. If you\u0026rsquo;re curious for more, check out this link:\nFinally, ElementaryOS also published an update. We now have multiple applications (Mail, Calendar, etc.) startup handled in system settings, meaning you can customize which applications you want to automatically run after log in. Also, Mail now uses the File Chooser Portal when picking a file, meaning it will always use the (most appropriate) system file picker. This update also mentions various redesigns, and you can find the full list here: Bram Moolenaar, the creator of Vim, has passed away # The family of Bram Moolenaar has announced the sad news on the Vim google group. The cause is an unspecified medical condition that progressed quickly over the last few weeks. The funeral service is currently being arranged, to be held in the Netherlands.\nIndian Defence Ministry switches from Windows to Linux # The reasoning behind the choice is the increasing cyber and malware attacks, and it affects all computers connected to the Internet. The distribution of choice is called Maya, based on Ubuntu, and it was developed internally for this purpose. They say that Maya has an interface and functionalities resembling Windows, making the switch particularly easy.\nMaya was developed within six months, and now the Army and Air Force are currently evaluating it. This is particularly interesting, especially if we go ahead and look at the Linux market share (according to statcounter) in India: it reaches the record value of 14%, easily beating MacOS (~3%) and ChromeOS (~0.24%).\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

If we temporarily stop looking at the Y-axis scale the graph seems promising: a clear, accelerating, constant growth; and this latest month saw a big spike. Of course, we do have to keep in mind that even the spike is just below 2%, which is even lower than what StatCounter reports as being the Linux market share in the general population (3%). And, as I always say, this game of playing with small percentages is rarely useful.\nThough, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a few words. Firstly, why is this happening? The answer obviously lies in the SteamDeck: Steam just sold quite a large batch of the handheld device. If we look at which distributions drove this spike, we immediately see SteamOS (and - surprisingly - Pop!_OS).\nSecondly, is it plausible that Linux is less used among gamers compared to the general population? Given just how predominant Windows is in the gaming market, that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprising. In fact, even MacOS has a significantly lower market share reported in the Valve survey\u0026hellip; even lower than Linux, thanks to the spike! This is the really interesting news: when game developers start thinking about which OS to offer compatibility for, they\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep in mind that Linux is a bigger potential market of users compared to MacOS – starting today.\nKDE shares the features to be removed in Plasma 6 # What you see in the above image is a pretty cool but hardly known feature of KDE Plasma; you can create \u0026ldquo;custom gestures\u0026rdquo; to be triggered simply by drawing shapes with the middle mouse button. As an example, moving the mouse towards the top of the screen whilst pressing that button might trigger the desktop grid, or switch to the above virtual desktop. This is particularly useful for drawing tablet owners, who can simply draw shapes whilst holding a pen button to activate Plasma functionalities. Pretty cool, huh?\nWell, this feature will die within months. It\u0026rsquo;s already unsupported in Wayland, and it relies on some quite old and hard-to-maintain code. Because of that, it has been decided to drop the entire codebase around it - called KHotkeys, because KDE - on the next Plasma version.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not the only victim of the major version switch. The global setting for the icon size will also be removed. The \u0026ldquo;Force Font DPI\u0026rdquo; option. Some low-quality task switchers (in Plasma, the dialogs that appear when you hit alt+tab are modular). The Air Plasma Style, which looks like this:\nThe list goes on, but even if you are a Plasma user you might not recognize many of the elements in it. These are often half-broken or hacky features, hard to maintain, and used by a few users. Nonetheless, if you are worried something you\u0026rsquo;re interested in might be in it, it\u0026rsquo;s worth giving a read to Nate\u0026rsquo;s (KDE dev) blogpost:\nThe Linux Foundation has a problem. It\u0026rsquo;s not what you think # Quick: if you google \u0026ldquo;Linux Foundation\u0026rdquo; and click on the first result, what is it going to be all about?\nOn my machine, the very first result - which is an advertisement from the Linux Foundation - brings me to this page:\nIn fact, it seems like offering training and certifications is a pretty significant part of the Linux Foundation. This might not come as a surprise to you, but I knew nothing about this. This is why I was so shocked today when I found a big rant about the Linux Foundation \u0026ldquo;stealing\u0026rdquo; money. What\u0026rsquo;s up with that?\nFirstly, let me point out that these certifications aren\u0026rsquo;t that cheap. To become a certified sysadmin, for example, you have to pay a whopping $400. However, I\u0026rsquo;ll admit I don\u0026rsquo;t have other offerings to compare the price to. Still, for that amount, you would expect a fair assessment of your abilities.\nGetting back to the above-mentioned rant: one year ago the Linux Foundation has changed the platform they take tests on, and since then multiple reports have appeared on how bad it is. Multiple users found it impossible to even take the test, with the platform just refusing to start citing internet issues. Then there\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;lag, freezes, problems with clipboard (when exam depends on copying from official docs), shell barely responding\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen I say \u0026ldquo;multiple reports\u0026rdquo;, I do mean it. I\u0026rsquo;m scrolling through the list on just one online community - r/kubernetes - and I can\u0026rsquo;t see the end. Some titles are quite, ehm, explicative of the bad experience (the platform is called PSI): \u0026ldquo;Massive rant about PSI\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;PSI is the worst\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Linux foundation is trash\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Traumatic PSI experience\u0026rdquo;, and so on.\nEven worse, the support from the Linux Foundation seems to be non-existent. Going back to the original rant, the platform failed multiple times to allow the user to take the test. Each time, the test was marked as failed. The only thing that the technical support did to help this user was simply to allow them to re-take the exam – even though it was pretty clear that, without addressing the underlying issue, that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help. The user tried to contact the supervisor about what was happening during the test too and received no response whatsoever. A reimbursement wasn\u0026rsquo;t granted either. Next step? Credit card chargeback.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to make of all of this. It\u0026rsquo;s not something that will directly affect desktop Linux; however, if you see rants about how bad the Linux Foundation is, you now know what\u0026rsquo;s likely to be the reason behind them.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

Firstly, today is the first day of GUADEC, which is similar to last week\u0026rsquo;s Akademy but for GNOME. Then, we have an API proposal to Chromium that might be quite risky for the future of the internet. Finally, we get back to the Cyber Resilience Act, which has been approved by an EU Committee. Let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nTiling is coming to GNOME too! # Pop!_OS has an optional auto-tiling feature, KDE Plasma has recently introduced a tiling screen, and now GNOME wants to play with this feature too! The coolest thing? Each desktop implements the concept of \u0026ldquo;tiling\u0026rdquo; in a completely different way, and it will be exciting to see each play out.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s step back and provide a bit of context, though. Today - June 26th - is the first day of GUADEC, which is the GNOME Users And Developers European Conference. On this first day, there has been a talk named \u0026ldquo;GNOME Design: State of the Union\u0026rdquo;, where many developers shared plans for the future of GNOME design in various areas of the desktop. Tobias Bernard talked about the shell itself, with some nice features coming up. A warning, before I go on: Tobias mentioned a blogpost will be up \u0026ldquo;today or tomorrow\u0026rdquo;, but there\u0026rsquo;s none at the time of writing, so information might not be super-accurate.\nFirstly, GNOME\u0026rsquo;s team wants to bring back an activity indicator on the top left of the screen. They decided to go with something that is not only a button (which opens the activities) but also an indicator that shows the number of desktops and which one is open:\nThen, the team wants to redesign the calendar that appears when you click the main clock; one of the ideas to clean it up a bit is to move the notifications to the quick settings section, similar to ChromeOS:\nThere would be more to talk about here (e.g.: a redesigned login screen) but let\u0026rsquo;s switch to the biggest announcement. Tobias talked about some sort of \u0026ldquo;tiling\u0026rdquo; functionality. The idea behind it - see first screenshot for reference - is that windows would still preserve their \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; size, but they would be automatically placed to be as close to the center as possible; and whenever you open a new one, the existing ones adjust to all still be as close to the center as possible.\nIf you instead decide to maximize something, it will open directly in a new activity/workspace; if you left/right tile, all other windows will switch to the other part of the screen. You can click on one to half-tile that to the other half of the screen. You will also be able to drag and drop a window onto a half-tiled one to switch to ¼-tiling.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not easy to explain through text, so I would recommend that you watch the talk from Tobias down below (it\u0026rsquo;s around 4h43m into this livestream):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/WVWrllJQJ_s?feature=oembed\nIs Google trying to DRM the Internet? # https://www.youtube.com/embed/0i0Ho-x7s_U?feature=oembed\nAs you can see, here I simply re-used the title given by YouTuber Louis Rossmann (known for advocating for e.g. right to repair). In this video, he warns about the following GitHub repository:\nThis link contains a proposal to add a new API that \u0026ldquo;determines the integrity of web environments\u0026rdquo;. The idea here is to make sure that the browser you are using is within a controlled and verified environment; as an example, if you\u0026rsquo;re using an Android phone, you would have the Google Play application attest that you are using your Chrome browser in a \u0026ldquo;safe\u0026rdquo; Android installation. This proposal comes from Google employees, and the (claimed) goal is mainly to detect non-human traffic on websites.\nLouis makes the case that this API would be terrible for users; in fact, he says \u0026ldquo;it would be the death of the internet as we know it\u0026rdquo;. As an example, take this sentence from the introduction of the proposal:\nThis trust may assume that the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data and intellectual property secure.\nEmphasis on: keeps [\u0026hellip;] intellectual property secure. The idea, thus, is that websites like Netflix or Amazon Prime (or maybe even Youtube itself?) could only display content if you are in a \u0026ldquo;trusted\u0026rdquo; web environment, to make sure their intellectual property is secure.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to see how this could raise problems. As a practical example, I own a tablet that - due to reasons - doesn\u0026rsquo;t have Google Play. In itself, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a big issue (at least, for non-Google things); but in practice, it renders the device almost useless. My biggest issue with it is that I can\u0026rsquo;t watch any Netflix, Amazon Prime, and so on: they all refuse to work because apparently, my tablet isn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;secure environment\u0026rdquo;. This same mechanism, if the proposal passes through, might easily apply to websites too. Even third-party browsers like Mozilla Firefox might be forced to implement this API if big websites like Netflix decide to use it (as the unacceptable alternative is for those websites not to work on Firefox).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about the worries of the users, you can also check out the extremely interesting YCombinator News thread:\nEU Committee approves Cyber Resilience Act (which is bad news!) # Both the above sections required quite some time to research and write, and we\u0026rsquo;re heading into yet another complex one! In short, the Industry, Research, and Energy Committee of the European Union has approved the Cyber Resilience Act, which means it will now be discussed in the EU Parliament.\nBut what\u0026rsquo;s this \u0026ldquo;Cyber Resilience Act\u0026rdquo;? Well, let me first say that the Open Source world seems to be unanimously against it: according to FOSS Force - see below - organizations that spoke against it include The Apache Software Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, GitHub, Linux Foundation, and others. Even the founder of /e/OS and Mandrake Linux has written an article named \u0026ldquo;Will the European Cyber Resilience Act Kill Open Source Software?\u0026rdquo; (quite a title!).\nBut why is it so bad? Well, the Act has been already featured in this newsletter, so I\u0026rsquo;ll pick up the paragraph I had written back then:\nThe proposal would require software developers to guarantee the security of their products \u0026ldquo;throughout the whole life cycle\u0026rdquo;, to offer a \u0026ldquo;coherent cybersecurity framework\u0026rdquo;, to improve the transparency of digital security, and to \u0026ldquo;use products with digital elements securely\u0026rdquo;. All of this is expected to have a compliance cost for the software developers; a cost that many Open Source projects might not be able to afford.\nBack then, the Act was in a \u0026ldquo;call for feedback\u0026rdquo; phase, and the Open Source Initiative was trying to convince the EU to add an exception for Open Source software. Apparently, that didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Ouch.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The plan is to contribute the project to an open-source foundation that will preserve free access over time. This is quite big news, especially given the big money commitment from SUSE; it shows that the last move from Red Hat has significantly weakened what RHEL was.\nAnother announcement that supports that is Oracle\u0026rsquo;s. They develop Oracle Linux, which is as close as possible to RHEL in terms of support. They released a statement, titled \u0026ldquo;Keeping Linux Open and Free - We Can\u0026rsquo;t Afford Not To\u0026rdquo; where they heavily criticize Red Hat reasoning:\nInteresting. IBM doesn’t want to continue publicly releasing RHEL source code because it has to pay its engineers? That seems odd, given that Red Hat as a successful independent open source company chose to publicly release RHEL source and pay its engineers for many years before IBM acquired Red Hat in 2019 for $34 billion. [\u0026hellip;] Two new alternatives to RHEL have sprung up in CentOS’s place: AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux. Now, by withholding RHEL source code, IBM has directly attacked them. And perhaps that is the real answer to the question of why: eliminate competitors. Fewer competitors means more revenue opportunity for IBM.\nThey\u0026rsquo;ve also stated that they\u0026rsquo;ll make sure that Oracle Linux continues to be as close to RHEL as possible. In fact, in a tweet, they\u0026rsquo;ve invited Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux to base their distributions directly on top of Oracle Linux:\n.@AlmaLinux, @rocky_linux, what are you going to do now that IBM has closed sourced RHEL by ending public distribution of its source code? Feel free…completely free…to redistribute all the source code in Oracle Linux…for free. Keep Linux Open and Free. https://t.co/ZZXM0JHRmy pic.twitter.com/qf9HkXGnty\n— Oracle Linux (@OracleLinux) July 10, 2023\nAgain, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that there has been a significant backfire from Red Hat decision; it\u0026rsquo;s going to be interesting to see if and how they will react to any of this.\nYou can find SUSE and Oracle\u0026rsquo;s statements here:\nThunderbird releases version 115, with Supernova redesign # The latest version of Thunderbird is quite a milestone. Firstly, it comes with a completely new logo, which you can see in the screenshot above. The design is consistent with Firefox\u0026rsquo;s and the blue bird makes the letter appear like a chat bubble. Then, we have the Supernova redesign, which brings a new Card View, pictured above, inspired by mobile interfaces. The calendar was also completely redesigned to be consistent with the new style, as you can see here:\nOf course, you might want to roll the interface back. 115 also brings a \u0026ldquo;Density\u0026rdquo; setting directly in the main AppMenu, which is introduced in this version for the first time. There\u0026rsquo;s also a unified dynamic toolbar, where \u0026ldquo;dynamic\u0026rdquo; means that the buttons will change depending on the current active view. Folders and tags were improved with eye-catching icons, and they\u0026rsquo;re now more customizable. All in all, this is a major release! There are still some important features to look forward to in upcoming versions, though: Firefox Sync - which will allow to sync read emails and calendars between Thunderbird instances - and Thunderbird for mobile (based on the K9 application).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a proposal to add telemetry in Fedora # Emphasis on proposal: the decision is yet to be taken. The idea is to collect some data, but only on an aggregated basis. The system would be opt-out: the proposal explicitly refuses the idea of opt-in. As a result, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of discussion regarding how to keep this completely anonymous, and there would be new policies to decide exactly which data to collect in a transparent way with the community. Of course, the end goal would be to make informed design decisions instead of having to guess what users are doing.\nFedora isn\u0026rsquo;t the only organization addressing this issue. KDE has recently implemented telemetry, though in a opt-in way instead of opt-out (meaning, telemetry is disabled by default). Other projects, like GNOME and Elementary, occasionally publish polls where users can state how they interact with their systems. All of these approaches have benefits and downsides; so, which one do you prefer?\nLinux reaches 3% marketshare on Statcounter, and 25% in Ukraine # Let me say immediately that the fluctuation in Linux market share in a certain tracker is hardly news, though fun to look at. However, given that lots of Linux users would like this OS to be more and more popular over time, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to occasionally look at the trends and data we have.\nThis particular goal, 3%, has made the news since it\u0026rsquo;s the first time Linux reaches it ever on Statcounter. By changing the country, however, we can see that other places have much higher Linux market shares: in India it\u0026rsquo;s as high as 13.8%, growing fast from 9.2% just last month. Considering that it was around 4% last year, it would be interesting to investigate what is driving this change.\nAnother country where there has been a Linux spike is Ukraine; it went from 4.4% in March to 25.5% this month, which is extremely impressive (five times more popular than MacOS!). This makes me wonder whether Statcounter is reliably getting data from these countries, though I see no reason why that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the case at least in India\u0026rsquo;s context.\nFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that worldwide we also have ChromeOS - which is Linux-based - at around 4.1%, for a grand total of 7.1%. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue or not.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The source code can still be obtained, but only through a contract that disallows re-use.\nRocky Linux, based on RHEL, thus has to search for another place to get the sources from. The first option they have is to use UBI container images that are based on RHEL and available online; using those, it should be easy to reconstruct the source code.\nAnother option is through pay-per-use public cloud instances: \u0026ldquo;anyone can spin up RHEL images in the cloud and thus obtain the source code for all packages and errata\u0026rdquo;. Both of these are legitimate ways to obtain the binaries.\nAlmaLinux, the other main distribution based on RHEL, has also put out a statement that explains the importance of re-builds; as an example, they talk about how they enriched the upstream community and made RHEL a better product. The project is investigating the best way to publish security updates after what happened.\nYou can read the statements from the two projects in full, here (the titles are surprisingly similar):\nBig update for InkBox, the Open Source e-ink OS # InkBox is a Qt-based operating system used in Kobo eBook devices; a refreshing change from the vast majority of e-ink devices which are completely proprietary.

The whole interface was redesigned, and now has \u0026lsquo;Recent books\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Pinned books\u0026rsquo; sections; a local library browser was even added. There\u0026rsquo;s now a To-Do application to create checklists and - optionally - KDE\u0026rsquo;s Qalculate application for complex mathematical calculations.\nYou can check the full changelog and working videos on actual devices here:\nValve is banning games with AI Art # Due to copyright reasons. It\u0026rsquo;s quite unclear what the legal ownership of assets generated with AI is, and Steam has decided to require that the developer has the right to the intellectual property of all images used in the training set.\nValve has said that their goal is not to discourage the usage of AI in Steam; rather, they\u0026rsquo;d like to integrate this AI copyright check into their already-existing review policies. They say: \u0026ldquo;our review process is a reflection of current copyright law and policies, not an added layer of our opinion\u0026rdquo;.\nOf course, it won\u0026rsquo;t be simple to recognize what constitutes an AI image in the future. The author of the above post has tried to re-submit the game, but editing the images manually to make them look not from AI; Steam noticed that and still rejected the attempt, but what if the developer had done that first? How would\u0026rsquo;ve Valve known about it?\nZorinOS (finally!) has an Upgrade tool # This might sound pretty weird to you, but the only way to upgrade between versions of ZorinOS was to do a clean install, whipping out all of your data. However, an Upgrader tool is now available, and - understandably - articles are saying this application was \u0026ldquo;much anticipated\u0026rdquo; and that it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;finally\u0026rdquo; here.\nThe tool allows you to also switch between the base, Pro, and Education versions, and also to perform a minimal installation; it will prompt you to reboot the system after the update is done. There\u0026rsquo;s not much else to say, except praising ZorinOS for introducing this necessary tool!\nI will also quickly mention that Zorin is looking for people to help translate this now tool to other languages (see the bottom of the page):\nMeta to publish Twitter alternative soon, Fediverse compatibility\u0026rsquo;s unclear # What you can see above is an email from a Meta employee to Kev Quirk, who maintains the Fossdoton instance of Mastodon. Even from other sources, it sounds like Meta is interested in interfacing Threads (that\u0026rsquo;s the name of the product) with the Fediverse; however, not everybody is happy about this. As you can see, Kev preferred to decline the proposal altogether, saying that he has \u0026ldquo;zero interest in having a conversation with Meta\u0026rdquo;.\nThe discussion lately has split the community: if Threads will indeed be part of the Fediverse, should Mastodon instances block it, or not? The discussion, however, might not be relevant: according to 9to5google (link below) it seems like Fediverse support won\u0026rsquo;t be coming immediately; rather, the wording is \u0026ldquo;Soon, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to follow and interact with people on other fediverse platforms\u0026rdquo;. Another detail is that you can restrict replies on a post; if you do that, the post won\u0026rsquo;t be shared outside of the Threads app.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

When signing up for it, you have the right - guaranteed by the GPL license - to see the source code, but Red Hat disallows any form of re-sharing of that code in the agreement. This has never been important, as RHEL\u0026rsquo;s code has always been open source and publicly available to everyone (customers and non-customers).\nBecause of that, distributions were created based on RHEL\u0026rsquo;s code with \u0026ldquo;bug-to-bug compatibility\u0026rdquo;. These, in practice, allowed using RHEL without becoming Red Hat customers. The most notable of these distributions CentOS, which was later (2014) adopted by Red Hat officially. In 2020, CentOS was discontinued in favor of \u0026ldquo;CentOS Stream\u0026rdquo;, which however has a significant difference: instead of being based on RHEL, Stream is more of a \u0026ldquo;development version/preview\u0026rdquo; of RHEL, always rolling with the latest changes.\nThis made CentOS Stream unappealing to enterprise customers, which require the stability of RHEL. Thus, new distributions (AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux) quickly raised in popularity by - again - using RHEL\u0026rsquo;s source code to provide a completely compatible downstream. Red Hat decided that these distributions are a \u0026ldquo;threat to open source, and one that has the potential to revert open source back into a hobbyist- and hackers-only activity**\u0026rdquo;.**\nThey have thus decided not to make RHEL source code publicly available anymore. However, the code can still be seen by Red Hat customers, including those with free dev accounts; in theory, Alma/Rocky Linux developers could make an account and use it. In practice, they can\u0026rsquo;t, as the agreement won\u0026rsquo;t allow them to re-distribute the source code they get this way.\nCentOS Stream code continues to be available for everyone, which is why Red Hat claims that they are not going closed-source. However, again, it is impossible for distributions to be based on CentOS Stream and achieve full compatibility with RHEL, since Stream is - again - more of a development preview.\nObviously, the move wasn\u0026rsquo;t well received in most of the Linux community, and there is an active debate on whether Red Hat is abiding by GPL or not.\nOpenSUSE uploads new Linux parody songs # https://www.youtube.com/embed/QbM2cYuLYd0\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to focus on something a bit more fun, now. OpenSUSE is known for releasing parody songs, which you can find in a playlist here. These include great classics like \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop the SUSE\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;We Didn\u0026rsquo;t Start the Kernel\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Uptime Funk\u0026rdquo; and many more. Luckily for us, they are still working on new songs, and we just got four new ones. The first one is \u0026ldquo;Where Open Source Grows\u0026rdquo;, which you can see above this paragraph. Here are the other three:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9pCb110s7M?feature=oembed https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlFPwTytRQI?feature=oembed https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPM_RUVahIc?feature=oembed\nOpera releases Opera One, a redesigned AI browser # Opera is working on releasing a significant update to their browser, featuring many features (including, of course, an AI assistant). By pressing Ctrl + / an overlay will appear, allowing for text input, which will be given to the AI called \u0026ldquo;Aria\u0026rdquo; (developed in collaboration with OpenAI). In theory, Aria should be able to integrate with the browser and e.g. be able to see search results, but it\u0026rsquo;s yet unclear how that will work.\nOther features of the release include \u0026ldquo;Tab Islands\u0026rdquo;, which will visually group together all tabs that you opened by e.g. clicking the results of a certain Google search:\nThe interface is also more modular, meaning that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to disable and enable certain components (including the above-mentioned Aria) or adjust them automatically based on the available space. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in checking out more about the new Opera, you can read here:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

This has led Reddit to respond, in some very weird ways.\nSteve \u0026ldquo;spez\u0026rdquo; Huffman (Reddit\u0026rsquo;s CEO) doubled down on the changes, saying that Reddit API was never designed for third party applications; then, he openly praised Elon Musk management of Twitter as a reference for him. He also said that the blackout \u0026ldquo;will pass\u0026rdquo;. However, since it didn\u0026rsquo;t, Reddit has started threatening the moderators of the communities who won\u0026rsquo;t re-open.\nThe first threat is: if some of the moderators doesn\u0026rsquo;t agree with the protest, then we\u0026rsquo;ll give them more priviledges, removing those who instead agree with it. The second one is less clear. The message ends in \u0026ldquo;if you\u0026rsquo;re not [\u0026hellip;] willing to reopen and maintain the community please let us known\u0026rdquo;, which many subreddits interpreted as a veiled threat of replacing the entire moderator staff.\nIn fact, that has happened: Reddit has recently removed the moderators of r/midlyinteresting and banned them for a week. This only lasted a few hours, and was then reverted. When The Verge asked for explaination, Reddit replied with \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to set a precedent of confirming with The Verge every action we do or don\u0026rsquo;t take\u0026rdquo;.\nFinally, the Reddit hackers who gained access to internal Reddit data in february asked for a ransom of $4.5 million, and then also added reverting the API changes on top of that. Reddit, again, declined to comment.\nCOSMIC will completely revamp Pop!_OS Tiling # And it\u0026rsquo;s looking great. Firstly, the COSMIC team decided to get rid of the \u0026ldquo;adjustment mode\u0026rdquo; dedicated to tiling windows; instead, you can now use Shift + Super + Arrows anytime to move the windows around. This would normally be quite standard, but it comes with many features; firstly, moving one window towards another will create a \u0026ldquo;group\u0026rdquo; of windows; this will have a white outline and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to change the layout within the group without affecting the windows outside of it. You can also move the group themselves instead of windows within it; and, finally, you can \u0026ldquo;stack\u0026rdquo; entire groups.\nStacking allows you to merge multiple windows together into one; in this case, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a \u0026ldquo;stack\u0026rdquo; icon on the titlebar, and a tab for each application within the stack:\nBoth the selected tab and the focused window, as you can see above, will be highlighted to make them stand out visually. You use tiling shortcuts to move one window within a stack around (e.g. outside of the stack) or you can select the entire stack and move that around.\nYou still have shortcuts to make a certain window floating, swap two windows side-by-side, move window focus, and so on. The main idea it to make tiling as intuitive as possible my making the group functionality automatic, so that you only have to use Shift + Super + Arrows to move windows where you want. Even better, even though the pictures you see above are mockups, all of this has already been implemented in COSMIC. The tiling system is the most powerful out there for a desktop environment, and by far (even considering scripts and extensions); I\u0026rsquo;m quite excited to see this in action!\nKDE Plasma 6 is liveable and in a code cleanup stage # Plasma 6 development has started months ago; initially, the system was very rough, difficult to compile and not in a daily-driveable state. A lot has changed since then, and KDE developer Nate Graham is now asking (developers or adventurous users) to try out 6 and see how it goes. This is especially easy since the development version of KDE\u0026rsquo;s distribution, Neon, now ships with 6 out of the box. Testing the master version is quite important for the next development steps: cleaning up the code, implementing the new features developers want to introduce in Plasma 6, and - finally - quality assurance and testing.\nThere are some details on the changes already implemented in Plasma 6, too. Some will be clear to users: there\u0026rsquo;s a new Overview effect that\u0026rsquo;s quite similar to what GNOME has, System Settings is starting to feature buttons in the header area too instead of placing them all on the bottom, and so on. However, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of under-the-hood changes: the SVG handling of KDE is now its own library called KSvg, duplicated UI classes are being removed, and so on.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no clear roadmap or deadline for this release, though. The idea is to publish 6 \u0026ldquo;towards the end of the year, or beginning next year\u0026rdquo;, which could be anytime between November and March 2024. If you can\u0026rsquo;t wait, though, you can try out the current state of things on Neon!\nAnother round of updates to GNOME\u0026rsquo;s large apps community # This week\u0026rsquo;s GNOME blogpost is actually the 100th they publish, which is a great achievement: congrats! Even though the changes in the GNOME project are quite technical, the list of improvements to third party applications is impressive and worth mentioning. Here\u0026rsquo;s what has been updated:\nDesign, the 2D CAD application, now has Line Types (such as donned, dashed, center, etc\u0026hellip;) and exporting to alternative DXF versions.\nFlowtime, a productivity app for time management (pictured above) has received statistics to keep track of the time you\u0026rsquo;ve worked vs breaks; a more compact view with just the timer; the ability to run in the background; and a customizable factor to compute break time (you work for x minutes, you take a break of x × factor minutes!).\nIPlan, a to-do/planning application, has redesigned its task rows, shown description/subtasks/due date/reminders in the task row, added a one-week view, and more.\nFootage, a tool to rotate/flip/crop/trim/mute/export vides, has been released for the first time!\nList, a simple to-do application, now shows the history of deleted tasks and a button to undo their deletion\nWildcard, a utility to test regular expressions, has also been published for the first time!\nEven better, this is just a selection I\u0026rsquo;ve made of the most interesting changes. You can check out a much longer list too:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The most noticeable changes compared to the previous version are updates to all the packages; Debian 12 uses GNOME 43, the Linux kernel 6.1 (the current LTS), LibreOffice 7.4, Python 3.11, and so on. In fact, Debian 12 even includes roughly ~10k new packages, for a total of ~60k; so, not only have they been updated, but there are also many more.\nIn Bookworm we get a visual revamp with a new \u0026ldquo;Emereal\u0026rdquo; artwork (used as wallpaper, boot image, in the documentation, etc). Bookworm also includes many new fonts, including Google Fonts. We also have more technical changes, like GRUB no longer running os-probe by default and a new malloc implementation.\nThough this is not related to the OS itself, Debian 12 is also the first version that includes non-free firmware in the installer, which should make it easier to try the distribution out. So, if you\u0026rsquo;ve never used Debian, this might be the best time to do that!\nThunderbird 115 beta brings the Supernova redesign # The Thunderbird team has announced the first beta release of 115, which will bring the big Supernova redesign (and is expected to be published during July). Thus, now it\u0026rsquo;s a great time to check out the (not final!) changes in the UI and provide some feedback to the developers.\nAlong with the interface changes, 115 also brings OpenPGP support for user-defined passphrases, signing and encryption of OpenPGP messages by default, and the ability to open the OpenPGP context menu using keyboard shortcuts.\nAnother feature that was anticipated in 115 is Firefox Sync (to sync the email client between devices), but the developers announced it won\u0026rsquo;t make it in time for the release. Hopefully, it will be implemented in a point release sometime after July.\nOh, and it would be terrible of me not to mention - since we\u0026rsquo;re talking Thunderbird - that the team has contacted the original designer of the logo to ask for a revamped version. Here\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like:\nGNOME makes it easier to donate to extension developers # Though the GNOME extensions community is often praised for just how many new functionalities and customization they introduce to the main shell, all of the work done by their developers is unpaid. It\u0026rsquo;s not surprising, then, that many extensions include links to donation platforms to help out with the development. GNOME wants to make that easier: you can now add PayPal/GitHub/KoFi/Patreon/BuyMeACoffee links to the metadata of your extension, and those links will directly appear on the webpage where you download it. Ideally, even clients that make it easier to download extensions could expose those links as well.\nThough this is certainly a small step, being able to incentivize donations to developers is an important step in making sure more and more work is put into extensions, and I\u0026rsquo;m very happy to see this change.\nThere is a strike from some StackOverflow moderators due to AI content # The introduction of ChatGPT and similar generative tools surely impacted websites like StackOverflow; not only fewer people are using them, sometimes preferring AI, but many are using them to answer existing questions. StackOverflow has recently introduced a policy that does not allow the removal of AI-generated content purely on the basis of being AI-generated. The moderators, through an open letter, claim that this will lower the quality of answers on the website and the policy makes it harder for them to do their job.\nAs a result of the strike, the amount of spam on StackOverflow might rise. Even SmokeDetector, a tool that automatically detects spam, has decided to join the strike, which could worsen the situation. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in hearing more about the problems behind this approach, what StackOverflow is working on, and what possible issues this strike might cause, I suggest reading the following (in-depth) article:\nVanillaOS posted a juicy update about their progress # VanillaOS is an interesting take on an immutable system; it introduces many tools to interact with system files for updates, and to create sub-systems that integrate with the main one; this allows installing packages without even touching the system files. Just a few days ago they published an in-depth article explaining the work they are doing for the next version of VanillaOS, codenamed Orchid.\nKeeping it short and simple: previously system updates were handled through the package manager, which installed them in an overlay, and - if the update was successful - that overlay would get applied to the system itself. Orchid changes that approach, and instead directly downloads the target image - which follows Open Containment Initiative standard for images - and simply uses that one. This makes sure that the system is always 100% reproducible and faithful to the one that the Vanilla team tested.\nThere are also two tools to create sub-systems; one is called Apx and it\u0026rsquo;s thought for developers. It allows to define \u0026ldquo;stacks\u0026rdquo;, which are made of a base system image and a list of packages to install on top of it. You can then enter the sub-system and change it however you like – and since they integrate with VanillaOS, you have the ability to install packages through apt, dnf, pacman, or any other package manager.\nThe second tool is called VSO (Vanilla System Operator), and it\u0026rsquo;s more similar to what users expect. Ideally, it would integrate with GNOME Software, and it allows installing packages that are either apt (in a Debian subsystem), nix, or Android (through Waydroid). This can be done through UI and the installed applications will directly integrate with the host system.\nThese are just a few of the changes that the VanillaOS team announced; if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this experimental project, I would recommend reading the full update:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

This is extremely important because AI tools currently raise privacy and copyright concerns. So, who won?\nThe top prize, $50k, was awarded to the \u0026ldquo;Sanative AI\u0026rdquo; project. The idea here is to \u0026ldquo;watermark\u0026rdquo; images through a small amount of visual noise that will make them useless upon training (as \u0026ldquo;the AI is unable to properly minimize its loss function\u0026rdquo;). Creating this watermark, which is different for each image, requires a great number of resources, and yet Sanative offers it for free through a queue. This approach has some potential issues: already uploaded images - without this watermark - can still be used for training, and AI organizations might find a way to get around the noise. However, Sanative AI is committed to improving its tool over time to remain effective.\nThe other two prizes ($30k and $20k respectively) were awarded to Kwanele Chat Bot and Nolano. The former is a mobile application to help victims of gender-based violence through an easy way to find local services and crisis centers, quickly contact friends and family in emergency situations, and contains step-by-step guides on laying a charge and getting a conviction (AI is used as a chatbot to help with these steps). Nolano, finally, offers \u0026ldquo;compression as a service\u0026rdquo; on top of any natural language model; this makes it possible to run the compressed models on low-end hardware such as smartphones and laptops.\nAll of these projects seem quite interesting and it\u0026rsquo;s great that Mozilla is participating in a fair \u0026amp; responsible AI development.\nRed Hat drops support for LibreOffice # This has been announced by developer Matthias Clasen: LibreOffice will be dropped from future Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases, with unclear consequences for the Fedora world. This is because RHEL priorities are switching towards finishing Wayland and HDR support, color-sensitive work, and so on. These are all important goals; however, the workforce is limited, and dropping LibreOffice in RHEL was a consequence of that. The announcement concludes with:\nThis also limits our ability to maintain it in future versions of Fedora.\nOf course, community members would be welcome to take over maintenance, which would sidestep the above issue; however, Matthias warns that this is a sizeable block of packages that requires a significant amount of work.\nIf I understood this correctly, the idea is not to leave the distribution without an Office suite entirely but to encourage users to install it from e.g. Flatpak. Because of this, there will be work in improving the integration with the Flatpak version of Libreoffice.\nReddit tries to kill third-party apps, Subreddits go on a strike # And, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s important. A few days ago, the maintainer of Apollo managed to talk with the Reddit staff regarding changes in the Reddit API (which currently powers all third-party Reddit apps and all Reddit bots). Much bad news was shared: Reddit wants to start charging for API usage, and the price is extremely high (Apollo would have to pay millions every month). All NSFW content will also be hidden from the API, meaning both that third-party Reddits apps won\u0026rsquo;t be able to show that content and that auto-moderation bots won\u0026rsquo;t be able to moderate them at all, potentially resulting in a NSFW posts surge.\nBecause of this, moderators of a variety of subreddits have organized a strike: starting on Monday, they will be making their subreddits private (either for 48 hours or until this issue is resolved). The requests are pretty simple, and they include lowering API prices by a factor of 12-15 and keeping NSFW content in them. These are not just a few subreddits: we\u0026rsquo;re talking about 18 subreddits with more than 10 million users each and thousands between 100k-10M. Even Linux communities, like r/linux and r/kde, will join the strike. Something like this is completely unprecedented in Reddit history.\nEven if you don\u0026rsquo;t use Reddit but like Open Source, there might be some interesting consequences. Many users are taking this occasion to propose Lemmy as an alternative to Reddit. Not only it\u0026rsquo;s FOSS and self-hosted, but Lemmy also integrates with ActivityPub, meaning it can interact with e.g. Mastodon. Thus, after Twitter controversies pushed that platform to the wider public, this strike seems to be doing something similar, making the open source social world stronger as time passes. The number of Lemmy tripled in the last few days and the number of monthly active users went from ~1.000 to ~4.500 within days, with no sign of stopping.\nLinux user share on Steam keeps on growing steadily # Given that the SteamDeck might be the most popular Linux computer you can currently buy, it\u0026rsquo;s extremely interesting to see the effect it will have on Linux marketshare, and whether it will convince its users to also try Linux on their personal machines. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say that for certain, given that we do not have precise data; but we do have the Steam Hardware \u0026amp; Software Survey, tracking the user share of Linux at least in the gaming world.\nThis is where the good news comes from: the Linux share almost doubled in the last couple of years, and it\u0026rsquo;s been in steady growth since then. Even better, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that this growth is happening faster and faster. We\u0026rsquo;re still talking about very small percentage numbers (~1.5%, whereas MacOS is ~2.4%); however, plugging in the estimated amount of Steam users tells us that ~1.5% converts into ~2 million monthly active users (though the real number is probably much higher).\nFinally, we have that roughly one-third of all of these users are on SteamOS (thus, on the SteamDeck). The most popular gaming distributions according to this survey are: Arch Linux, Ubuntu, and Manjaro.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

The next LTS release of Ubuntu, though, a Desktop version of it will also be released, meaning that it will be aimed at normal users and not just IoT devices. Users won\u0026rsquo;t be able to install applications through apt (as immutable systems disallow changing the system files) but they will have to use snap for anything.\nThis shouldn\u0026rsquo;t come as a big surprise; Ubuntu is slowly switching to snaps for all of its apps. For example, just a few days ago we discovered that even CUPS (which manages the printing stack) will be switching to Snaps for the Ubuntu 23.10 release. However, note that this immutable Ubuntu version will not be the only one; the traditional LTS desktop version will still be available for everyone.\nNintendo stopped Dolphin emulator release on Steam # As a bit of context, Dolphin is an emulator for the GameCube and Wii consoles that support Windows, Mac, and Linux. The project aimed at being released on Steam, making it much easier to install and use; however, Valve initiated a conversation with Nintendo to check whether that could\u0026rsquo;ve brought legal issues, and Nintendo said that Dolphin would indeed violate the DMCA anti-circumvention provisions; as a result, Valve took down the project.\nNote that this only refers to its page on Steam; the project itself is still available to everyone through their website and github (since it\u0026rsquo;s free and open source). Note that the discussion is not about whether emulation is illegal; According to a Citra Developer, the exact reason for the takedown is that Dolphin illegally distributes Nintendo\u0026rsquo;s WII decryption key, directly in the source code. This is required for the emulator to work, but you cannot \u0026ldquo;legally\u0026rdquo; obtain a key either, so they decided to add one as a compromise.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s now a light theme for GNOME shell # Currently, the light/dark themes have no impact on the colorscheme used by the GNOME shell itself; the top bar, the applets, and the overview used a dark color regardless. Even though that\u0026rsquo;s quite elegant, some people might prefer a light scheme! A recent MR managed to bring color-scheme setting support for the shell as well, meaning that you can achieve the look in the above picture. To do so, you will have to choose \u0026ldquo;prefer-light\u0026rdquo; in the colorscheme, which currently is not exposed to the user at all; unless something changes before the GNOME 45 release, you will have to rely either on third party applications or a DCONF editor to change that setting.\nThis is not the only visually appealing change in the GNOME world; as an example, Libadwaita introduced a new page-based navigation component that all GNOME applications can now use; it looks great, and it\u0026rsquo;s easier to use than AdwLeaflet:\nFinally, there has been a facelift to GNOME Calendar application as well, which now makes use of more Libadwaita components and has a very pretty delineated sidebar:\nAs always, this week we\u0026rsquo;ve also seen releases of many GNOME applications: Cartridges 1.5 (which is now part of the Circle), IPlan 1.2 (with subtasks, records, project/task descriptions, and so on), Imaginer 0.2.2 (with the ability to run stable diffusion locally), Halftone (for lossy image compression), and so on.\nFedora will drop X11 with Plasma 6 release # Fedora has made Wayland the default for Plasma releases for quite some time; with the release of 6, they now plan to stop offering X11 entirely. The first reason to do that is that RHEL (the enterprise distribution of Red Hat) has deprecated the Xorg display server since May 2022, and Fedora might want to follow a similar path. X11 is also no longer developed and is only kept alive with some patches, whereas Wayland is quite active and almost ready to place of Xorg.\nStill, it\u0026rsquo;s a quite risky move, as there are still blockers to using Wayland with Plasma. The developers expect all blockers to be addressed by the time 6 is released, but there\u0026rsquo;s no clear timeline nor guarantee that it will happen. If it does, though, it will be interesting to see if Wayland will, indeed, be able to cover all usecases of X11 users without creating big enough issues to make them switch away from Fedora.\nNew report on MAUI apps progress # MAUIKIT is quite an interesting toolkit to create applications based on KDE\u0026rsquo;s Kirigami project. However, it focuses on great aesthetics and introduces components such as CSD. Just a few days ago, the developers published a new report on the progress done in the previous months. So, what\u0026rsquo;s new?\nFirstly, we now have color styles introduced specifically tailored for E-Ink and AMOLED displays. In the former case white-black colors are used, whereas black is the main color for AMOLEDs to save on battery life; The FileBrowser now supports pasting raw images and text directly into a new file, and it has been redesigned with a cleaner interface; there are new CSD button styles (basically, themes for titlebar buttons when CSD is enabled); Terminal now warns users of active processes if you try to close it, and has better touchscreen support; and so on.

Even if you were not able to attend Red Hat has been live streaming and releasing some of the content from this summit.\nMost of my time has been spent in the Community Central Theater learning about thing like EPEL 10 and Podman Desktop.\nKDE Plasma introduces rough HDR support # This is quite a technical topic, but as a brief introduction: the current standard for displaying colors on monitors, called sRGB, only covers part of the spectra of visible light, and the range of brightness that it defines has an upper bound of 80 nits, significantly lower than what most monitors can do.\nIf you have a monitor that is able to display a wider range of colors, or has a wider brightness range (thus \u0026ldquo;High Dynamic Range\u0026rdquo;, or HDR) it\u0026rsquo;s not immediate to start displaying colors on it. If you try to force sRGB on it colors will look incorrect and overly saturated: they have to be mapped back to their correct position in the color space.\nThis means that enabling HDR will have no effect on most of your programs: the desktop, the browser, and the vast majority of applications still use sRGB and do not support (nor require) the wider color/dynamic range. However, there are games, videos and drawing applications that support HDR, meaning that the compositor has to use a different colorspace depending on what application you\u0026rsquo;re using.\nThis is what you\u0026rsquo;re seeing in the picture above: a monitor where all the content is SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) except for the video player, which is using HDR. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see the difference, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to capture it in a picture! Achieving it required changes in KDE\u0026rsquo;s Wayland compositor (KWin), and developers are currently working on a new Wayland protocol to manage color profiles for different monitors. This is quite a step forward already, and if you\u0026rsquo;d like to read about the progress with (many!) more technical details, you can do it here:\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re already talking about KDE, there are a couple of improvements to other places of the shell too. Firstly, settings that previously used a checkbox but that apply instantly are now being ported to switches, which brings a much nicer look:\nAlso, pressing shift whilst scrolling on the Volume icon in the System Tray will allow you to finetune your volume; check out the whole list here:\nThird major release of the keyboard-driven browser Nyxt # After two whole years of development, Nyxt 3.0.0 is out. It\u0026rsquo;s a browser \u0026ldquo;inspired by Emacs and Vim\u0026rdquo;, as in: it focuses its navigation experience entirely around keyboard shortcuts. Instead of \u0026ldquo;tabs\u0026rdquo; you have \u0026ldquo;buffers\u0026rdquo;, which have been completely revamped in this release for readability and aesthetics. The browser will also restore the session automatically on startup, and it will also try to guess your next command in its \u0026ldquo;execute-command\u0026rdquo; menu. It has a steep learning curve, but now there\u0026rsquo;s much more documentation available and there\u0026rsquo;s a Flatpak build available for easier installation (though the project is not on Flathub yet).\nImprovements across the board in GNOME Settings # Just this week, GNOME has implemented various improvements to its settings application with the goal of making them easier to understand for all users. Firstly, there\u0026rsquo;s now an information popup that explains how the Automatic Login setting work; on the same page, the user name row now uses the standard \u0026ldquo;AdwEntryRow\u0026rdquo; component instead of implementing its own; in the \u0026ldquo;Sharing\u0026rdquo; page of Settings, each entry (\u0026ldquo;File Sharing\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Remote Desktop\u0026rdquo;, etc.) now has a subtitle that explains how it works. There is even a new standard widget button component that displays more information, which can now be used throughout Settings.\nStill in GNOME land, whenever you remove an application you can now choose whether to delete or keep the application data, depending on whether you\u0026rsquo;d just like to save some disk space or you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to be able to recover all content if you re-install the app. Also, the Document Scanner application has been ported to GTK4 and libadwaita, and it has also gained multithreaded image resize (with a ~10 fold performance improvement) and a new design for page reordering and more. Check out the full changelogs here:\nFeatured: GNOME Web actually GOOD now?? # GNOME Web has made some big improvements, but can it compete? The short answer is no. This video features the history of the browser, the development, and its current state.\nOnyx will, indeed, be the Immutable Fedora Budgie spin # I already covered this when this opportunity first arose, but now it\u0026rsquo;s confirmed: the next version of Fedora (39, which should be released around mid-October) will include a spin called Onyx which will be immutable and it will use the Budgie desktop. Onyx will join the family of immutable Fedora distributions, which currently includes Silverblue (featuring GNOME) and Kinoite (featuring Plasma).\nKubuntu Focus launches the M2 Laptop # Kubuntu Focus is a company producing high-end products featuring Kubuntu. The idea is to reach, by only choosing one distro, a much tighter integration between the OS and the machine; they install a wide range of applications out of the box, and they\u0026rsquo;ve all been tested by them on each setup. They also offer various guides and documentation on how to use the most common applications, and they have their own suite to manage the machine. The M2 laptop is their flagship product, starting at $1895, it has a QHD 240Hz display and a 5.4Ghz core i9-13900HX. The other specs depend on the setup you choose, but they\u0026rsquo;re just as impressive. As a writer\u0026rsquo;s note, I\u0026rsquo;m not sponsored by Kubuntu Focus, but I do use their NX computer as my daily driver.\nEditors Note: I would like to thank all the new folks for signing up for the newsletter.

The first big one is panels that can be freely customized; that is, you can move them around, change their size, have multiple panels, and even make them float. Similarly to KDE Plasma or XFCE, the panels contain applets that can be customized (by adding new ones, removing them, and moving them around). One main difference with Plasma is that each applet lives in its own process, meaning that the desktop would still work even if one of them were to crash. Furthermore, one unique feature is the ability to change the transparency of the panels directly from their settings. The blogpost contains lots of screenshots with different setups, so make sure to check it out if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.\nThe blogpost also talks about settings; the various pages within it are modular, meaning that there\u0026rsquo;s an API to add and remove pages; this could be used, as an example, by distributions that want to add setting pages tailored for them. More updates include work being done on HDR (which is expected to take a couple of years), new 10-bit color support (a prerequisite for HDR), and the work by the project to add accessibility functions to the Iced toolkit used throughout the desktop:\nBlueSky just open-sourced its app code # Interestingly enough, there has been a push on Twitter and Twitter-like platforms to open source their code; we have Mastodon - which is fully open source and distributed -, the Twitter algorithm, and now we also have the code of the BlueSky application. This is an important step, as it allows others to fork their code and build their own BlueSky clients or improve the existing application through Pull Requests.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s significantly better than what Twitter did, as the algorithm code was only partially available (e.g. we do not have any kind of training set) and it was a fork frozen in time rather than the production code itself. But of course, neither project can beat the open-source nature of Mastodon, which is fully open-source and decentralized to its core.\nOn the other hand, this week a blogpost was released by developer fiatjaf that explains the issue in the protocol used by BlueSky; the claim is that the protocol is currently completely controlled by BlueSky, and much less decentralized \u0026amp; open than initially claimed:\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in understanding how ActivityPub\u0026rsquo;s protocol (which powers Mastodon, Pixelfed and others) work under the hood, there\u0026rsquo;s this article that goes in some technical detail without being too difficult to understand:\nOver the last 6 years, Thunderbird\u0026rsquo;s income grew 875% # Namely, it went from $736K to $6.4M, which is absolutely impressive. For reference, other (big!) open-source projects like Krita and KDE earn roughly $80k and $200k yearly respectively. It\u0026rsquo;s clear that Thunderbird is doing something right. Firstly, they started interacting with the community much more at the end of 2021 through blogposts and newsletters. They also introduced an in-app notification kindly asking for donations, and of course, there was the release of Thunderbird 102. This allowed the project to double the number of people working on the project in 2022 alone! The next big steps for the project are the Supernova release this year, but most of the refactoring and redesign work will mostly pay off in 2024, especially with the release of Thunderbird on Android (through improvements on K9 Mail).\nThe spending in 2022 was \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; $3.5M, and it mostly (~80%) went into personnel. Other less expensive items are administrative fees, donation processing fees, professional services, and \u0026ldquo;computer and tech\u0026rdquo;.\nMicrosoft will try to convince Firefox to switch to Bing by default # Mozilla currently has an active partnership with Google to make sure they use their search engine as the default; it\u0026rsquo;s a quite profitable deal too, as it\u0026rsquo;s rumored to earn Mozilla between $400M and $500M yearly. However, it\u0026rsquo;s up to renewal in 2023 and Microsoft might want to try to convince Mozilla to switch to their search engine instead. The timing is perfect, given the spike in Bing interest raised by its integration with ChatGPT.\nFedora won\u0026rsquo;t switch from Terminal to Console anytime soon # You might not even be aware of the difference, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite an interesting story. Terminal was the previous console application by GNOME; however, with the release of GNOME 42, they decided to introduce Console as a \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; application, meaning having it shipped by default as part of the desktop. However, both Fedora and Ubuntu decided that the new application is not as appealing as the one it was trying to replace, and they decided to stick with Terminal.\nThis is a bit of a misstep from the GNOME project:\nWe messed up by adding [Console] to core before downstreams were comfortable with it, and at this point it has become unclear whether Console should remain in core or whether we should give up and bring back Terminal,\nLuckily, this made GNOME shape up a new formal process for evaluating applications before making them part of the core set of apps_._ Of course, users can still switch between the two apps depending on which one they prefer; realistically, however, most users will instead keep the default application provided by their distribution.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

Now that it has finished, we have many attendees publishing their work on their personal blogs, meaning we can some insight into what happened (especially since I, Niccolò, was also there). Such a week means there are a lot of new features and changes in KDE Plasma, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking at it in a longer section than usual:\nNate Graham, as an example, talks about all the default settings that will be changed in 6 to make it a more appealing release; we will have double click by default (especially since most Plasma-based distro were already changing KDE\u0026rsquo;s single-click behavior), hopefully, Wayland by default, and floating panel as well. The idea behind this last change is that it looks good and it will help Plasma differentiate itself from other OSs, design-wise. There\u0026rsquo;s also a colorful change: title bar will probably be slightly tinted with the current accent color, which you can even set to be automatically picked from the wallpaper. The task switcher changed too, from the left sidebar to a centered collection of thumbnails and big icons. There are more changes, which you can check out in Nate\u0026rsquo;s full post:\nWe also have reports from developer Kai Uwe, who spent some time improving \u0026ldquo;Itinerary\u0026rdquo;, KDE\u0026rsquo;s application that manages travel information and bookings; as an example, Itinerary live information now includes canceled stops and shows the reason, and the \u0026ldquo;Comfort Check-In\u0026rdquo; was also analyzed for later implementation. The dinner reservation was also in Itinerary, and Kai improved the ability to share it with others. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s now a QR scanner in the Wi-Fi applet to avoid having to write the password at all.\nDeveloper Noah Davis instead worked on implementing \u0026ldquo;Segmented Buttons\u0026rdquo;; these are generally used to communicate mutually exclusive options, such as the \u0026ldquo;grid/list/tree\u0026rdquo; view buttons in the Dolphin file managers. However, KDE isn\u0026rsquo;t making use of them as they do not exist at all in Qt, the UI toolkit. Thus, Noah implemented them for the first time directly in Qt and officially proposed them.\nFinally, I haven\u0026rsquo;t published any blogpost or video (yet) on what I worked on, but let me briefly summarize it. I spent half of the week re-vamping the Overview effect completely, which now integrates the grid view of desktops as well. Basically, invoking it will show all of your open windows on your desktop, and invoking it again will zoom out and show all of your desktops. This is actually similar to what GNOME does, and the design is inspired by their work as well. I spent the other half working on a completely new application to make it easier to render cool promotional videos upon release; it integrates directly in Inkscape, meaning that you can use it as a normal SVG editor and then just add keyframes and easing curves.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in Firefox 113 and 114 beta # 113 is the latest release of the Firefox browser, and it comes with enhanced picture-in-picture and improved security features.\nPicture-In-Picture (PIP) is the ability to detach videos from their usual position on webpages and leave them floating around whilst you e.g. browse other pages. Now it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to rewind back, check the video duration, and directly switch to fullscreen only using the smaller PIP representation; previously, these features were only available in the full video playback.\nOther changes include a better automatical password generation, better Windows GPU sandbox, support for AV1 images, and also brings support for color functions such as lab(), lch(), oklab() in CSS (which is great news for developers).\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re talking Firefox, let\u0026rsquo;s also take a sneak look at the next version coming up, 114. The biggest change will be a major revamp of the DNS over HTTPS functionality, previously disabled by default. Now it\u0026rsquo;s running out of the box and brings three layer of protections: \u0026ldquo;Default Protection\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Increased Protection\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Max Protection\u0026rdquo;. Another big feature is \u0026ldquo;Cookie Banner Reduction\u0026rdquo; - off by default - which will try to automatically select the least amount of cookies possible on the website banner so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s a new \u0026ldquo;Quick Actions\u0026rdquo; button in the Address Bar suggestions which allows you to quickly clear cookies or history, take screenshots, and so on.\nRead more about it here: https://9to5linux.com/firefox-114-beta-revamps-dns-over-https-feature-adds-cookie-banner-reduction\nA new way to customize columns in GNOME Files # There are some goodies coming in the GNOME land as well; the previous UI to select the columns was using the GtkTreeView component, which is now deprecated. Developer Corey Berla has thus written the view from scratch, which allows you to select which information to show either globally or just for the current folder. The new UI is quite pretty and simple to use, with drag handles to change the order of the information.\nWe also have improvements in Loupe, the image application that\u0026rsquo;s currently being incubated (meaning that, if everything goes well, it should soon be used from GNOME out of the box). This week, Loupe integrated the Breakpoint libadwaita feature that was introduced just last week; basically, it means that the application can change the layout radically as soon as the width/height of the application is below a certain threshold. Now, if Loupe is used in a small device such as a phone, the properties view will adapt to it and still work flawlessly. Also, when viewing images on fullscreen, the mouse and headerbar will hide after a few seconds to let you enjoy the image fully.\nSome third-party applications are reporting as well on the weekly GNOME podcast; one example is the brand new app Bavarder, which simply works as a frontend to AI chat (you can select whether you want Hugging Chat, BAI Chat, OpenAI GPT-3.5). If you use these new AI tools regularly, this app will make it easier; but I can assure you that this newsletter is still all written by a human!\nThe developer of Fly-Pie announces cross-platform support # Not quite, actually; instead of bringing Fly-Pie to other desktops, the developer has decided to start the work from scratch in a cross-platform manner. In fact, the goal is to not only support Linux desktops, but Windows and (maybe) macOS.\nThe name of the new project is \u0026ldquo;Ken-do\u0026rdquo;. In terms of features, it should look and behave roughly the same as Fly-Pie: by middle-clicking or using a certain shortcut it will create a floating circle with various options, and each option can have its own circle with sub-options. These are completely customizable. A new feature of Ken-Do will also be creating a different menu configuration depending on the application you\u0026rsquo;re currently using, and it will be possible to use Ken-Do to select values (e.g. controlling the volume or screen brightness).\nYou can check out the project and/or sponsor its development here: https://ko-fi.com/post/Introducing-Ken-Do-L3L7L0FQ2\nFramework shares more details on Ryzen laptop # They had already announced the new laptop in March, but we only got some more detailed information now. I won\u0026rsquo;t go too in-depth, but let me mention that the specs are: Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 7 7840U, with a thermal system specifically designed to keep the laptop cool, and AMD Radeon 700M / Radeon 760M as graphics cards. This also means that using an eGPU is available out of the box. Since Frameworks laptops are so flexible, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to use the mainboard as a standalone computer too, using a third-party case or 3D printing your own. You can also upgrade a previous Frameworks laptop to the new mainboard, a quite an impressive achievement.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

This will make it easier for first-timers to join Mastodon, especially if it\u0026rsquo;s the first time they try a \u0026ldquo;federated\u0026rdquo; social network; there will surely still be time for them to understand that there are various different servers and switch between them, but the first step - making an account for the first time - has to be as simple as possible if we want more and more people joining.\nMeanwhile, the official Mastodon account has also confirmed that quote posts are on their way to be implemented soon. The main developer was initially skeptical of that feature, but times have changed (and lots of users asked for them to be implemented). Also coming, according to the same post, is \u0026ldquo;search and groups\u0026rdquo;.\nKrita: \u0026ldquo;2023 will be a year of utter uncertainty\u0026rdquo; # Krita, KDE\u0026rsquo;s open source painting program, has published a blogpost talking about how 2022 went and what they expect to happen in 2023. I found the article quite interesting and honest, describing - yes - the many achievements that Krita has reached in 2022 (as we\u0026rsquo;ll see), but also talks about a complex monetary situation and developers needing a break.\nAt the beginning of 2022, Krita decided to stop chasing functionalities after bug reports and decided to have a meeting to decide on the most important features Krita was missing on how to address those. This resulted in some significant work being done: a rework of the brushes behind the scenes, a text object that supports SVG2 with CSS with word-wrap and all, better assistant features, a better welcome page, and so on.\nHowever, there has been a decline in income (mostly in donations) that Krita attributes to the higher economic pressure caused by the recent events; and they say:\nIf we want to continue like this, well, we will need more money, there’s no way around that. This year, 2023, will be a year of utter uncertainty.\nAll in all, 2022 was, like I said, tough. We made amazing progress given the constraints. But it was a year that tried temper\nIn 2023, Krita plans to release the 5.2 version, but it might be delayed, as the developers will likely take a bit longer break after 2022.\nFedora might get an immutable Budgie spin # Fedora is currently offering a couple of immutable spins; the most known one is Silverblue, which uses the GNOME desktop. A different spin is called Kinoite and instead uses the KDE Plasma desktop and KDE apps (also offering unofficial master builds for developers). These spins are supposed to be particularly stable, less prone to bugs, and easier to test and develop on: applications (apps) and containers are kept separate from the host system, improving stability and reliability.\nThe latest news is the proposal to add another spin, codenamed Fedora Onyx, which would use the Budgie desktop; Fedora 38 already optionally comes with Budgie, as you can see above, but it would be pretty cool to have an immutable version as well\nNitruxOS also now includes Waydroid # Just after a week of BlendOS announcing the same feature, NitruxOS also now includes Waydroid of the box. This allows users using Wayland to use Android apps right out of the box with no loss in performance. Note, however, that it\u0026rsquo;s also getting easier and easier to download and start using Waydroid on other distributions as well, often being just a download-package-and-go.\nOther features of this release include the Maliit keyboard - which makes it easier to type on touchscreen devices - again on Wayland-only, Firefox better-handling touchscreen input, and the usage of the \u0026ldquo;better distro kernel\u0026rdquo; Liquorix 6.2.13, along with the very latest KDE Plasma.\nNew apps joining GNOME Incubator \u0026amp; Circle # Starting right away with Snapshot! The application, a camera application for desktop and mobile, was recently accepted in the GNOME incubator. These are a set of programs that are being considered for GNOME core, meaning they could be included as default applications in upcoming GNOME versions. Currently, the only other app in the Incubator is Loupe, a very actively developed image viewer I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about before. Snapshot has released its preview on Flathub, so you can check it out there.\nAnother application has also joined the GNOME Circle, a set of third-party applications that follow the GNOME design guidelines and thus receive some tools and help from GNOME directly. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about Telegraph, an application that translates between text and more code in a very simple UI. The developer is Felipe Kinoshita, who is also a KDE developer and had previously developed the same exact application, with a similar interface, using KDE\u0026rsquo;s Kirigami UI library.\nOf course, there\u0026rsquo;s also a lot of applications getting new features and bugfixes; you can read about all the last week of progress on the GNOME side here:\nUbuntu 23.10 will be called Mantic Minotaur # That\u0026rsquo;s it. It\u0026rsquo;s a great occasion to remind everyone that this version will be published on October 12th, 2023; though we are so early in development that not much else can be said. In fact, even the name won\u0026rsquo;t really mean anything in practice, except this is a great occasion for people like OMG Ubuntu writer Joey Sneddon to try to make some m-based jokes:\nThis Machiavellian mandate may manifest as a milestone worthy of …Nope, I’m running out of words beginning with M\nMy take isn\u0026rsquo;t significantly better:\nMajestic Mantic Minotaur materializes, marking milestone moment! Meticulously-managed, mighty modular, matchless multitasking, maximizes memory management. Mantic Minotaur maintains majestic momentum, masterfully merging man-machine milieu.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s everything for today; May our paths cross again, manifesting more meaningful moments.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

As you can guess by the version number, one of those things is switching from GTK2 to 3. The branch containing the remaining work on that front has been recently merged, completing the transition: GIMP (on the master branch) now uses GTK3, a big milestone.\nSo, what else is missing before being able to release 3.0? Firstly, full Wayland support: the application runs there, but it still has many bugs, especially in the window management area (think about all of GIMP\u0026rsquo;s floating toolbars, for example). We\u0026rsquo;re also missing improvements in color management (e.g. being able to export and import CMYK colorspace images) and a redesign of the API for scripts and plugins (currently in progress).\nThis means that GIMP 3.0 will still need some significant work before being ready to be published, but this week\u0026rsquo;s achievement is still a significant step forward for the project.\nBlendOS 2 has been released # BlendOS is a distribution that, in a way that\u0026rsquo;s quite similar to VanillaOS, \u0026ldquo;blends\u0026rdquo; together packages from different distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch) by installing them in \u0026ldquo;boxes\u0026rdquo; whilst keeping the OS itself immutable. BlendOS supports both GNOME and Plasma desktop environments and uses an installed adapted by the one developed by CrystalOS.\nThe lead developer, Rudra Saraswat, has just announced the second major version of the distribution. Firstly, the distribution now supports Android applications out of the box through Waydroid and includes the F-Droid and Aurorae app stores. Support was added for Web Apps and PWAs, treated as normal desktop applications. You can also submit them to the Blend store. Support was also added for the AUR (Chaotic-AUR, specifically) and Arch packages. Finally, the distrobox component has been re-implemented using podman, though some of the existing code was preserved in the rewrite.\nThe first distro to have an experimental Plasma 6 ISO is KaOS # As mentioned, the development of Plasma 6 has started; this means that the \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; branches of the KDE Plasma desktop and Frameworks, where developers are working, are now to be built with Qt6. Over time changes and fixes will be added to this branch, preparing for the release; this means that right now \u0026ldquo;Plasma 6\u0026rdquo; looks exactly like \u0026ldquo;Plasma 5.27\u0026rdquo; because we\u0026rsquo;re so early in development. Usually, it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to try out what the team is working on by downloading a distribution that uses packages always built from the master branch, like KDE Neon. However that is no longer true of Plasma 6, and the first distribution to offer an image that\u0026rsquo;s built using Qt6 and the master branch is KaOS.\nThis means that the ISO is not a \u0026ldquo;preview\u0026rdquo; of the next Plasma release, but rather an easy way to test the changes that will be added over time whilst KDE developers do their job. It\u0026rsquo;s still quite relevant, especially for developers who want to help out with the release but can\u0026rsquo;t build the latest version themselves.\nThe newly released KaOS version also includes various new applications, like Tokodon (KDE\u0026rsquo;s Mastodon client) and the desktop application of Signal. It also comes with a revamped welcome app that allows you to directly points you to some settings you might want to change.\nAudacity releases version 3.3 # The latest Audacity release covers the last seven months of development of the project, and has a good set of changes and new features; starting with a new \u0026ldquo;Shelf\u0026rdquo; filter that can be set for High-shelf or Low-shelf. More and more effects can also now be previewed before being applied to the entire audio (which could take some seconds or more). There\u0026rsquo;s also a new \u0026ldquo;beats and bars\u0026rdquo; feature that turns on snapping of other clips based on their beats, making it easier to align audio to a certain music base. BPM has to be either set by the user, or an automatic third-party tool like the Vamp plugin can be used.\nVarious other changes include: a new ruler called Linear (dB), which goes from 0 dBFS to -∞ dBFS and better reflects the volume as shown in the recording/playback meters, a “Delete” button to the Cut/Copy/Paste toolbar, a new Time Signature toolbar that’s hidden by default in this release.\nRound of improvements to GNOME applications # In the latest \u0026ldquo;This Week In GNOME\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; blogpost, we had a super big set of improvements to GNOME applications, either part of the project itself or within the Circle organization. So let\u0026rsquo;s dive in! The first one is Loupe, an image viewer, which now has image printing, ICC color profile support, faster SVG rendering, and more.\nAuthenticator, which generates two factor authentication codes, has released a new version with \u0026ldquo;one of the biggest code cleanup we have done since the port to GTK 4 \u0026amp; Rust\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s also now able to export backups to FreeOTP + JSON, and importing images with QR codes.\nWorkbench, a GTK/GNOME technologies sandbox, also came out with a new update that makes it \u0026ldquo;fully sandboxed and now considered Safe by GNOME Software\u0026rdquo;. The application is quite interesting, and allows you to e.g. immediately preview Blueprint UI files:\nThen, GNOME Network Display has added support for Chromecast, which should be included in GNOME 45; there\u0026rsquo;s a new application available on Flathub, called Dino, which allows for chat and video calls; there\u0026rsquo;s a new version of the Tube Converter, a Youtube videos downloader, which allows setting maximum download speeds and added support for a new download backend; Denaro - money tracking application - released a new version as well with the ability to add notes to certain transactions and more.\nThen, phosh (a Wayland shell for mobile devices) now has an off-by-default emergency button that appears if you long press the power button. It\u0026rsquo;s off-by-default for now because they would like to get more testing before including a feature that should be extremely reliable. There\u0026rsquo;s a new release of the Graphs application as well, with a complete UI redesign:\nYou can also now edit the plot style, save projects as single files, there\u0026rsquo;s better handling of the clipboard, and more. Finally - I told you it was lots of improvements! - there\u0026rsquo;s a new release of Cartridges as well, an application to launch games, that also comes with a new, super pretty design:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

In this newsletter issue, I\u0026rsquo;ll cover the releases from Fedora, Proton by Valve, the Vivaldi browser, Deepin (though the release is 20.9 and not 23), and digiKam (KDE\u0026rsquo;s photo management application).\nFedora 38 released, with new spins and packages # The new version of Fedora comes with new wallpaper, a website redesign, new spins, up-to-date packages and an improved desktop, and more. Let\u0026rsquo;s go through all the changes; the new wallpaper is easy, as you can look at it just above this paragraph. The new website is of course not part of the OS itself, but it\u0026rsquo;s still a significant visual refresh aligned with the release and that required the collaboration of different design teams and the community.\nThen, we have two new official spins: \u0026ldquo;Sericea\u0026rdquo;, which uses the Sway window manager on Wayland, and \u0026ldquo;Budgie\u0026rdquo;, which uses the Budgie desktop environment. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s also an official Fedora 38 Phosh image, which is meant for mobile phones (Phosh is a modified Gnome shell for those types of devices). Fedora 38 Workstation now comes with Gnome 44 out of the box, with some fixes that will make sure the system shuts down faster. On the more technical side of things we have that microdnf was replaced with dnf5, which has performance improvements and a smaller memory footprint, and key programming languages have been updated to be the very latest.\nValve releases Proton 8, the \u0026ldquo;Biggest Rebase\u0026rdquo; so far! # Proton 8.0 is now available with many changes. Our biggest rebase to date! Note: it requires a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 support. Experimental-8.0 will follow sometime this week.\nPierre-Loup Griffais, a Valve developer, has announced the availability of Proton 8; this comes with a long list of games that are now playable (you can go through the list in the above-embedded tweet) and various bugfixes to existing games. Many of these improvements come from the fact that Proton 8.0 uses the latest version of Wine, also coded 8.0, which is the compatibility layer that Valve uses to play non-native games on Linux (not through emulation, which would have an impact on performance, but by translating Windows API requests to POSIX calls on the fly, which should be faster).\nWine 8.0 is a major release, thus Pierre-Loup said \u0026ldquo;biggest rebase\u0026rdquo; in its tweet. Interestingly enough, some blogposts have sneakily changed that to \u0026ldquo;biggest update\u0026rdquo;, a quite different claim.\nVivaldi 6.0 released, with Workspaces and Custom Icons # Though the feature is advertised as \u0026ldquo;Custom Icons\u0026rdquo;, the new release of the Vivaldi browser allows you to completely change the theme of the browser - even reaching some pretty wild customizations, such as the WindowsXP-esque one you see in the picture above. According to the announcement, the built-in theming tools make it \u0026ldquo;relatively easy\u0026rdquo; to change colors, background, and icons. The announcement contains a video that goes through the steps required to create a new theme, and it indeed looks relatively easy. You can insert the hex codes of the required colors and upload image files to be used as icons. Overall, as a KDE person, I cannot help but praise Vivaldi for the customization options they now expose.\nThe other big feature is Workspaces. It\u0026rsquo;s a combobox on the left of your tabs that allows you to quickly switch between different \u0026ldquo;workspaces\u0026rdquo;, where each workspace has its own theme and open tabs. You can go even further using the Tab Stack and Tab Tile functionalities to organize tabs within the same workspace in different categories and then see a split view with different tabs. Overall, this seems like a super feature-packed web browser!\nDeepin 20.9 release as a mostly-bugfixes update # In this release-packed week, we also got a new Deepin release. Please note that the main development of Deepin is the 23 release, which is available as an alpha, and that has been in the works for quite some time. Thus, the 20.9 release is mostly about making sure that the Deepin 20 version is still up to date and contains the very latest bugfixes. As an example, 20.9 upgrades the Qt toolkit to 5.18.8, which is the latest (and last) LTS release of Qt5. Many applications were also updated (log viewer, image viewer, drawing board, software package manager applications) but the announcement text mostly describes what those applications are and how to use them rather than describing what\u0026rsquo;s new in this particular update.\nKDE releases new DigiKam major version # DigiKam is KDE\u0026rsquo;s application to do photo management. The latest release comes with completely reworked documentation, making it the best-documented KDE application out there. You can find it at the link below, but it\u0026rsquo;s also included in the app itself.\nThe new update has lots of features: support for raw images of many more cameras, there\u0026rsquo;s a new text recognizer tool that can transcribe the text in your images (which also comes with a new language setting page to manage it), reading metadata of files has been re-worked to be more reliable, there are many improvements to the Advanced Rename tool for batch photo renaming, and so on. A highlight is the inclusion of a neural network tool that assigns a \u0026ldquo;quality\u0026rdquo; value to each image depending on the content, subject, design, colors, and so on; this is integrated into the Batch Queue Manager, allowing you to e.g. sort by this \u0026ldquo;AI quality\u0026rdquo; value. There are other major features I haven\u0026rsquo;t covered, so if you need a photo management application make sure to check out the full announcement:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

In March, the developers decided to introduce a more complex (and powerful) way to customize their system, which relies on three elements: \u0026ldquo;styles\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;modes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;variants\u0026rdquo;. Quoting from their official blog post:\nA style has up to three modes: mixed, dark and light. Each of these modes can contain color “variants”. A variant is a combination of themes which work well together.\nIf I understood this correctly, the \u0026ldquo;Style\u0026rdquo; is the actual theme you\u0026rsquo;ll be using (e.g. Adwaita), the \u0026ldquo;Appearance\u0026rdquo; section will allow you to switch between light and dark mode (or \u0026lsquo;mixed\u0026rsquo;, where multimedia apps will be dark), and the \u0026ldquo;Color Variants\u0026rdquo; will be used as the accent color for the system (as an example, folders will follow that color).\nAnother significant change is that all monochrome full-color icons were removed from the default Mint-Y theme. I know that \u0026ldquo;monochrome full-color\u0026rdquo; sounds contradictory, but let me explain: there are two kinds of icons, \u0026lsquo;full-color\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo;. Using the former makes sure that your icon will look exactly as you made it, whereas symbolic are meant to be only black-or-white and they can be recolored by the system. This means, as an example, that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to maintain two different sets of symbolic icons for the light and dark theme.\nMint-Y still used to offer some black-and-white icons, but as \u0026ldquo;full-color\u0026rdquo;, since some applications still used those in various parts of the UI (e.g. Transmission). They decided to drop those entirely, which means that those applications will now fallback to Adwaita icons (which are colorful). You might be disappointed in the change, but it\u0026rsquo;s up to the applications now to decide to switch to \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; icons.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s now a full-time developer working on KDE Connect 2.0 # Most KDE projects do not have full-time developers working specifically on them, and KDE Connect was one of them. However, that has changed thanks to a grant from the NLnet foundation, which will now allow developer Albert Vaca to work full-time on it. In his latest blogpost, he has highlighted the main areas of improvement for the future, teasing a \u0026ldquo;KDE Connect 2.0\u0026rdquo; update.\nThe first improvement will be in reliability, especially when connecting two devices for the first time. Given that KDE Connect works through your local network, devices have to discover each other to connect; this is currently done through UDP broadcasts, which have been proven to be sometimes unreliable. A better approach would be to use multicast DNS, and the team did try to implement it in the past with no luck. Now Albert is back at it!\nTwo other things will happen thanks to the NLnet foundation: KDE Connect will get a security audit from Radically Open Security to make sure that all transferred data is sent securely between devices, and there will also be an accessibility audit from the HAN University later this year.\nSystem76\u0026rsquo;s COSMIC DE is taking shape # Ahh, spring. Sun is shining, birds are chirping, and COSMIC is blossoming into a beautiful desktop environment prototype.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s quite an interesting way to start a blog post! System76 is currently working on building a desktop environment from scratch in Rust using the iced toolkit (in fact, contributing to it quite a lot). So, what\u0026rsquo;s new? There\u0026rsquo;s a redesign for the application launcher, which you can see in the picture above.\nOn the more technical side of things System76 created cosmic-time, an API to create (complex) animations using the iced toolkit. This won\u0026rsquo;t only benefit COSMIC, but any application using the same toolkit can now use the crate to implement their animations. The first project to do so was an application called \u0026ldquo;bazaar\u0026rdquo;.\nOther developments are aimed at reaching feature parity with the latest version of Pop!_OS; as an example, the tiling functionalities are now almost the same as they were, and many widgets (the components that developers use to build applications) are being re-introduced using the new toolkit. This is also a good time to do performance improvements that will impact all applications and the desktop; as an example, the text editor received some changes that halved the RAM usage and made startup half a second faster.\nImprovements across the board on GNOME Circle Apps # Pictured above is Mousai, part of the GNOME Circle. The application can be used to identify songs using the audd.io API, and has features to build a repertoire of recognized apps and listen to them. The developers just announced release 0.7, which comes with a redesign of the interface, fuzzy search matching for song titles and artists, MPRIS support (meaning you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to control music playback from the system tray or such), and an offline mode. There are more significant features not mentioned here though, so if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this application you should definitely check out the full blog post.\nAnother application receiving improvements this week is Curtail, which is a GNOME tool to compress any kind of image. Now it\u0026rsquo;s really any, given that support for SVG files was just added. The latest release also comes with a switch to GTK4, the UI not freezing whilst compressing, and other improvements. If you need to compress files often, you might want to check this one out.\nOther improved apps are Chess Clock (with a major overhaul to the screen to select the time control), and Gaphor (a UML modeling tool that also recently switched to GTK4). Check out all the new features here:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

We start off with Pine64 providing great news for three devices: the PineNote (e-ink tablet), the PineTab 2, and the new \u0026ldquo;PineTab V\u0026rdquo; (which is the PineTab 2, but with a RISC-V board).\nThen, there\u0026rsquo;s System76 announcing they\u0026rsquo;re working on an in-house manufactured laptop codenamed \u0026ldquo;Virgo\u0026rdquo;. Moving to phones, Ubuntu Touch has released its first version based on the latest LTS of Ubuntu, and Plasma Mobile also improved a lot whilst working for the Plasma 6 release.\nPine64 announces the first RISC-V Linux Tablet # \u0026hellip;and much more. Pine64 announcements are always packed with the news! The latest one was published on the 1st of April, meaning that it features lots of colorful unicorns as an April Fool joke. And the newly announced tablet is also an April Fool joke, but it\u0026rsquo;s also not.\nRISC-V is a new experimental standard instruction set, and Pine64 would ship the device as a way for the developers to start working on hardware integration – but without any OS out of the box. The back of the chassis will be black to distinguish it from the normal PineTab 2. And there\u0026rsquo;s news on that side too: it will be officially available from the 11th of April. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, the article contains some more information on the speed of the device and its hardware support.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also great news for those of you interested in Linux e-ink tablets: it\u0026rsquo;s now really easy to flash any OS on the PineNote (which is exactly that). As an owner of the device, let me tell you that it\u0026rsquo;s a game changer compared to the very complex instructions you had to follow before that! There are currently a couple of OS modifications for the PineNote based on GNOME and Sway. Hopefully, a KDE alternative should pop up soon too.\nSystem76 CEO teases new in-house \u0026ldquo;Virgo\u0026rdquo; laptop # Carl Richell, CEO of System76, has published a couple of pictures of their work-in-progress in-house manufactured laptop. This is quite exciting, as it\u0026rsquo;s the first attempt - to the best of my knowledge - of the company to manufacture in-house. Of course, much more time will be needed for the end product: we\u0026rsquo;re still early in the early design stages, and a couple more months might be necessary for the first prototype.\nUBPorts announces Focal-based Ubuntu Touch # Last week, the very latest Ubuntu version you could get when using Ubuntu Touch was 16.04; now, Focal (20.04) is available too, which is quite a big upgrade for the project (currently community-developed by UBPorts). It\u0026rsquo;s quite an important step if you consider that 16.04 was the last LTS when Canonical cancelled the Ubuntu Touch project: it means that the community has managed to step up and continue the development.\nThere are a few supported devices, right now: Fairphone 4, Google Pixel 3a, and three Vollaphones. Other devices might have partial support as well. The new update also changes the name of the desktop - from \u0026ldquo;Unity 8\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Lomiri\u0026rdquo; -, replaces Anbox with Waydroid, moves development from Github to Gitlab, replaces Upstart with Systemd, and much more. These are just the infrastructural changes: there are lots of new features and bugfixes in each component. See the full list here:\nRound of updates for Plasma Mobile # Lots of things are happening in the Plasma world, which is currently preparing Plasma 6. This applies to the Mobile section as well, with developers working to build the project with Qt 6. Since they were at it, we have many significant refactors of the shell itself, which should now be faster and much more stable. Nonetheless, the most interesting part of the development update is all the new features coming to Plasma Mobile applications (all of which are convergent, so that they work flawlessly on Desktop as well).\nBoth AudioTube (Youtube Music client) and PlasmaTube (Youtube client) got a redesign that makes them much prettier and more usable. Arianna (EPub reader) now has a settings page that uses the MobileForm component (= it looks awesome) and now compiles on Windows and Qt6, Tokodon (Mastodon client) can now create polls. For space reasons I can\u0026rsquo;t embed the screenshots of all of these changes (and more), but I\u0026rsquo;d suggest checking out the following blogpost for a lot of eye-candy:\nBloomberg Launches FLOSS Fund # Basically, Bloomberg has done three rounds of elections to award three grants of 10,000€ each to projects they rely on, to give back to the community. The first selected project is Apache Arrow, which \u0026ldquo;makes data transfer and analytics lightning-fast for a number of data-intensive applications\u0026rdquo;. The second project is Curl (the same one you can use in your terminal!), which is \u0026ldquo;implicitly part of billions of interactions every day — yet is still essentially developed by one lead and a tiny group of contributors\u0026rdquo;. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s Celery, \u0026ldquo;a primary task management tool in the Django and Python ecosystem\u0026rdquo;.\nOf course, money isn\u0026rsquo;t the only way to help out FOSS projects (though it is a big factor). The company wants to engage directly with the projects as well, which is another great way to help out. The announcement ends with a nice quote:\nDeveloping programs that support the open source community through a multi-pronged approach isn’t just philanthropy, says Wright: It’s common sense. “It’s an investment in our shared infrastructure,” she says. “It’s infrastructure that we all rely on and it needs to be taken care of.”\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

They\u0026rsquo;re either sold pre-built, or in a \u0026ldquo;DIY Edition\u0026rdquo; where you have to build it yourself and bring your own OS (including Linux).\nSo, what\u0026rsquo;s new? Well, a new high-performance 16\u0026quot; laptop is coming, and it has an \u0026ldquo;Expansion Bay\u0026rdquo;: the back is detachable and allows for modular upgradeable graphics. This is all open source, meaning that mechanical drawings, 3D CAD, and electrical reference designs are available to the public. This makes it super-easy for customers or third parties to provide custom modules.\nThe 13\u0026quot; model got revamped as well: it got upgraded to the latest 13th Gen Intel Core processors, but there\u0026rsquo;s now also an AMD option as well (using the Ryzen 7040 Series). The latter uses the same chassis as the Intel option but comes with DDR5 and an AMD-compatible WiFi card.\nFinally, the 13\u0026quot; also gets a higher capacity 61Wh battery, a matte display, improved hinges and speakers, new Bezel colors, and more. If you\u0026rsquo;re upgrading from an older Framework device you can simply buy the new motherboard, and Frameworks now offer a \u0026ldquo;Cooler Master Mainboard Case\u0026rdquo; to re-use the old one (e.g. as a server).\nGNOME releases version 44 # And it has thumbnails in the file chooser. Yay!\nThis feature comes together with the grid view, which will make \u0026ldquo;selecting images\u0026rdquo; much easier. As GNOME\u0026rsquo;s own announcement notes, \u0026ldquo;this has been one of the most positively received changes in our history\u0026rdquo;.\nApart from this, the main focus of the release is on the redesign of various Settings pages. Firstly, there\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;Device Security\u0026rdquo; one which now tells the user if the security checks went well or not in a more understandable matter and allow to export of a full security report for the device.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Accessibility\u0026rdquo; section also got revamped with \u0026ldquo;over-amplification\u0026rdquo; (i.e. being able to increase the volume above 100%), shortcuts to enable accessibility features, a test area for cursor blinking settings, and a setting to make scrollbars always visible.\nThe redesign also included the sound settings - which are now much cleaner - and the \u0026ldquo;Mouse \u0026amp; Touchpad\u0026rdquo; section, which now has videos to explain what the \u0026ldquo;Scroll Direction\u0026rdquo; setting does.\nOther changes in this release are: improvements to the quick settings menu (specifically to the Bluetooth section, and the new background apps section), a redesign and performance improvements in the Software application, some more Tabs settings for Files, etc.\nYou can check out the full changelog here:\nCinnamon is now officially an Ubuntu Flavor # Ubuntu Cinnamon is, as you might\u0026rsquo;ve guessed, a derivative of Ubuntu that ships with Linux Mint\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo;s Cinnamon desktop instead of GNOME. It is now officially part of the Ubuntu family, which comes with many practical benefits: more quality assurance, a new bug tracker, images being built daily by Canonical\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure, and more. This won\u0026rsquo;t have an immediate direct impact on the user experience but should improve the project in the long term. It also means, of course, that new developments in Ubuntu software (such as the new Flutter-based installer) will land in Cinnamon as well.\nBut this is also more than just a milestone from a practical point of view; in the announcement, the lead developer of the distro shares just how much this goal means to the project:\nKDE introduces XwaylandVideoBridge to fix XWayland screen sharing # Here\u0026rsquo;s what happens when you currently try to share your screen from e.g. Discord whilst in Wayland:\nThat\u0026rsquo;s no good, as there are no windows listed. This also applies to any \u0026ldquo;Xwayland\u0026rdquo; applications (which we can summarise as \u0026ldquo;X11 applications running in Wayland\u0026rdquo;): MS Teams, Slack, Zoom, etc.; that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty big problem for those who want to switch to Wayland.\nKDE Developers David Edmunson and Aleix Pol wrote \u0026ldquo;XwaylandVideoBridge\u0026rdquo; to fix that. It\u0026rsquo;s an application that has to be run, and it will prompt you to ask what window or screen you\u0026rsquo;d like to share. Done that, it will appear on any XWayland application to be selected. This does have a slight overhead, but it\u0026rsquo;s negligible compared to the streaming of the screen itself. You can download the application right away using Flatpak; and if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the technical details you can check out the blogpost by David:\nHow websites can track you through fingerprinting # When you enter Private Browsing all cookies and history is wiped; this should, in theory, give you higher anonymity on the web, especially if you use always-private browsers like Firefox Focus. However, websites are still able to identify you without having to rely on cookies at all but by using fingerprinting. The idea is simple: through the information that the browser offers to the websites (browser version, number of CPUs, screen size, video/audio codecs, OS, etc.) a unique ID is generated; surprisingly, \u0026ldquo;each user\u0026rsquo;s device and browser specifications differ so much that they get a unique ID among millions\u0026rdquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to check this out through companies offering fingerprinting as a service, such as FingerprintJS Inc. (pictured above). If you visit their fingerprint example page, delete all cache and data, and open the website again the ID won\u0026rsquo;t change. One way to avoid this, if you use Firefox, is to turn on privacy.resistFingerprinting in the about:config page. If you use Chrome/Chromium, though, there\u0026rsquo;s no inbuilt protection against fingerprinting.\nYou can learn more about it here:\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

Hub 4 introduces AI tools that are available to everyone, and an \u0026ldquo;Ethical Rating\u0026rdquo; that is based on the availability of the model, the original code, the training data, and such. This makes sure that anyone can make an informed choice on whether to use these tools or not.\nOne of the main AI features is speech-to-text. Hub 4 makes use of Whisper, which has been recently published by OpenAI (and whose models are freely available). This means that, anywhere in Nextcloud, you can start transcribing your voice with great accuracy and with automatic translation if necessary.\nThen we have GPT text generation, again using the models by OpenAI. This feature is still available throughout Hub 4 apps, meaning that anywhere you can invoke GPT to e.g. write a first draft of an email, brainstorm some simple ideas, or fill out basic information. The UI gives you one result by default, but you\u0026rsquo;re able to see more than one through advanced settings.\nFinally, there\u0026rsquo;s image generation through Stable Diffusion. This uses DALL-E models released by - you guessed it - OpenAI. Similar to what Google claims to be offering in their Workspaces, you\u0026rsquo;re able to describe an image to quickly get one generated. This could be particularly useful for early drafts or as references for further work. (Image generation, obviously, has still its own issues to address).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s great that Nextcloud is the first service offering these workspace-integrated AI tools for everyone, but some compromises were made to achieve this. There\u0026rsquo;s no context awareness that Microsoft and Google are claiming (as an example, you can\u0026rsquo;t simply type \u0026ldquo;make a summary of this email exchange\u0026rdquo;, unless you copy-paste it). You don\u0026rsquo;t have app-specific fine-tuning options (e.g. a \u0026ldquo;tone of voice\u0026rdquo; button when drafting emails). And there\u0026rsquo;s no way for the AI to directly interact with the content you\u0026rsquo;re working on.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean all these features can\u0026rsquo;t be added in the next versions. To make - yet another - example of what we\u0026rsquo;re able to achieve, there\u0026rsquo;s a proof of concept that allows you to ask GPT to edit 3D objects in Unity; maybe something similar could be achieved by exposing Nextcould\u0026rsquo;s API to GPT?\nAll of this, powered by a \u0026ldquo;Smart Picker\u0026rdquo; # The way that Nextcloud approaches offering the above tools throughout Hub 4 apps is by having a new component called \u0026ldquo;Smart Picker\u0026rdquo; that will pop up whenever you insert the character \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; in a supported text field (quite similarly to Notion, if you\u0026rsquo;ve used that). You\u0026rsquo;ll have the ability to select what type of content you\u0026rsquo;d like to insert; we\u0026rsquo;ve already discussed the \u0026ldquo;ChatGPT-like text\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;AI Image Generation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;AI Speech-to-text\u0026rdquo; options, but there are more.\nYou can translate between languages (using DeepL and Nextcloud Translate), insert text templates that you prepared beforehand, insert an OpenStreetMap location selected using an interactive map, link a PeerTube video with a UI to search through them, search through movies/series/actors from The Movie Database, share toots and Mastodon links, and even share gifs from Giphy.\nYou can also interact with other parts of Nextcloud through the Smart Picker; as an example, you can create new tasks on Deck on the fly. Sometimes, the content you inserted will be embedded, e.g. inserting an OpenStreetMap location in a text document will embed a viewer with all of the map\u0026rsquo;s options (search, zoom, layers, \u0026hellip;).\nAnother great example is the fact that you can quickly embed Tables, but maybe I should first explain what those are.\nHub 4 introduces the Nextcloud Tables App # This application is presented as an alternative to Microsoft Sharepoint. If you\u0026rsquo;re not aware of what that is either, MS describes it as an \u0026ldquo;intelligent intranet\u0026rdquo;, which allows for internal document management and acts as a storage system. By comparison, Nextcloud Tables offers a way to \u0026ldquo;manage and work with data structures, putting together easy \u0026lsquo;apps\u0026rsquo; and connecting them to various other components in Nextcloud\u0026rdquo;.\nPromotional speech aside, Tablet allows you to create tables with custom columns and various types of content that each column can contain. As an example, you could have a table of employees where each row has \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; (text), \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; (date), \u0026ldquo;number of working days\u0026rdquo; (int), \u0026ldquo;approved\u0026rdquo; (yes/no) fields.\nYou can create them from scratch or from templates, export data to CSV/clipboard, import data from the clipboard, and most importantly you can share tables with other users but control permissions for each sharing. From this point of view, Tables is quite similar to Notion as well; or at least, to a subset of it.\nAnd finally, here\u0026rsquo;s the Smart Picker allowing you to select a Table, as I mentioned:\nNextcloud Talk: Video Recording \u0026amp; Breakout Rooms # Nextcloud Talk is an application for Nextcloud that allows hosting online meetings, sharing the screen, and so on. In Hub 4, there are two new major features; firstly, the ability to record a meeting. After the call, you can send the recording in the chat ta make sure it\u0026rsquo;ll be available for everyone. This is quite an important feature that\u0026rsquo;s often used e.g. to register video lectures or important meetings for people to catch up later on.\nSecondly, there\u0026rsquo;s the introduction of \u0026ldquo;Breakout Rooms\u0026rdquo;, which are quite useful for larger interactive calls (e.g. e-learning). This allows splitting the users into sub-rooms within a call, where they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to interact with each other. You can then move users between rooms, send messages to specific rooms, and so on. When activating this functionality you can choose tnumberunt of rooms to split the members in and whether the division should happen automatically, manually, or by choice of each member.\nNextcloud Files: Advance File Versioning # The File Manager application of Nextcloud already had file versioning capabilities, as is common in online hosting services. However, Hub 4 brings in two very important features to set it aside from competitors. The first one is simply the ability to give a name to a specific version of the file, which makes it significantly easier to go back to a certain draft instead of having to guess the exact time and date you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. This is especially useful when reverting files written by colleagues, since reading the name of each version is much faster than seeing what actually changes in each one.\nAlso - similar to backup tools like BackInTime - Nextcloud now uses a \u0026ldquo;time-based algorithm\u0026rdquo; for versions. This means that one version is kept for each minute in the first hour, then one version each hour for the first day, then one version each day, and so on. This provides great granularity in reverting recent changes but uses much less storage space than actually keeping one version for each minute for the past months (obviously!).\nFinally, there\u0026rsquo;s a little AI component here that will show you the \u0026ldquo;recommended\u0026rdquo; files at the top of your files list, trying to guess which ones you\u0026rsquo;re interested in based on previous behavior. The same applies to the share dialog, which guesses who you want to share the file with.\nOh, and according to the project announcement, \u0026ldquo;N_extcloud Talk reduced loading times, server load and notification delays by up to 99%_\u0026rdquo;. Of course, the more exact meaning of \u0026ldquo;up to 99%\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t that clear, but that seems like a pretty impressive optimization nonetheless.\nMore Hub 4 New Features # There are some improvements to Nextcloud Collectives as well. As a bit of context, it\u0026rsquo;s an application that allows to organize markdown-formatted knowledge in pages and sub-pages, a bit like Wikis. The new Nextcloud makes it easier to create new Collectives and to move pages between them. The collectives also link to the Files, which makes it easy to find where each file that\u0026rsquo;s part of it is stored. Better collaboration is coming to Text as well, where you will see the cursors of other people working on the same document as you.\nNextcloud File Drop, a feature to send other people file through a hyperlink, now supports End-to-End encryption for increased security in your organization.\nNextcloud Deck, a project management app, now uses a Nextcloud Text component to edit paragraphs on the cards; this allows for formatted rich text, and also makes sure that the Smart Picker mentioned above works perfectly here as well. This release also brings support for live editing by multiple people, exporting boards to CSV, and creating new tags when assigning them.\nA little useful new feature, Nextcloud Mail allows you to add attachments when creating an appointment in the Calendar.\nFinally, we have the ability to embed videos within documents, manage the installed fonts, and watermark official documents with a custom text or logo. These are of course only the highlights of the release, which comes with many more bug fixes and performance improvements.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links and images were lost in the migration process.

This is how the ArtStation main page looks at the time of writing:\nImage by @joysilvart\nThe same “No AI” images could be found on DeviantArt and have been tweeted by many artist accounts, even by KDE’s Krita app. Two lawsuits (1, 2) have been filed against AI Art tools. And it’s not just art: ChatGPT has been using AO3 fanfiction as training data, prompting many writers to only make their stories accessible to registered users; and the introduction of Copilot by Github, an AI to suggest code, resulted in another lawsuit being filed.\nLet’s go step by step. To actually generate anything you need to train a model. Taking Stable Diffusion’s art model as a reference, you can see it as a 4Gb file, whereas the training data is 2.3 billion images. Obviously, there’s no way to compress all the training data - we’re talking about hundred of million of images - in such a small size; in theory, all of the training images are “forgotten” by the model and only the patterns remain. (In practice? Not quite, but we’ll see that later).\nThis means outputs from these models should be “original” in the sense that they don’t replicate any of the input training images: they don’t “assemble” an image, nor do they “copy and paste” or \u0026ldquo;do a collage\u0026rdquo; - that is, in theory - a common criticism done to AI images, even in the lawsuit explanation website itself:\nThe lawsuit website goes on to explain a bit of the theory of diffusion and latent spaces.\nAlso, some models allow users to input an image and a prompt to output that image modified through the prompt. It’s very important to distinguish this from the training part: the model is not trained on images provided by users. If you’re using a model, it has already been trained. Uploading an image to Midjourney, as an example, will only have the effect to make it use that image as a \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo;, you could say, and not as training material.\nMost of the time, we - as users - cannot directly use the model or see what it was trained on, as the companies that authored them prefer not to share them. However, we can make some educated guesses on what the training data included. Sometimes companies do try to be somewhat transparent: as an example, we do know that Copilot is trained on public Github repositories.\nRegarding image generation and text instead, we have Common Crawl, a non-profit that scrapes webpages and releases them as datasets:\nScreenshot of Common Crawl\u0026rsquo;s website, including a brief explanation of what they do.\nThis easily includes content coming from stock images or art websites, in the case of images. ChatGPT, as an example, uses Common Crawl for text; the same did Stable Diffusion through another non-profit called LAION that actually groups the images together and filters them:\nScreenshot of LAION\u0026rsquo;s website, including an explanation of what they do and their main datasets.\nIn all of these cases, it’s clear that the data was used for training with no regard for whether it was licensed/copyrighted or not.\nIs any of this legal? Tough question, actually. (Regarding “ethical”, we’ll also get to that).\nThe argument - done by companies like Microsoft and AI researchers like the Fair Learning initiative - is that training is covered by fair use. To determine whether that’s the case, the two main questions are: “does training change the nature and use cases of the original works, and does it compete directly against the copyright holders?”. The Verge asked Daniel Gervais (“professor at Vanderbilt Law School who specializes in intellectual property law and has written extensively on how this intersects with AI”); he says that “it is much more likely than not” that training is indeed covered by fair use, but it might be necessary to check that for each situation (as we’ll see later). Of course, this doesn’t allow you to generate any kind of image: you can still be held accountable if you specifically ask for some content that might be infringing. “Spiderman flying through buildings” would be a somewhat risky prompt, as an example.\nAbout that, there’s also a quite significant flaw.\nIn theory, all of the content generated by these AI is completely original; however, it sometimes happens - as an unintended behavior - that some training data is output as is (or almost). This has happened to Copilot in multiple cases (even prompting Github to add a training data filter). The author of this tweet even managed to make Copilot spit out code he had previously written and published:\nhttps://twitter.com/ChrisGr93091552/status/1539734582177562625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1539734582177562625%7Ctwgr%5E291207be03447bee5e559e902954df2f07440686%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10\u0026amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techhut.tv%2Fai-needs-to-deal-with-copyright-laws%2F\nHere’s another example:\nhttps://twitter.com/StefanKarpinski/status/1410971061181681674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1410971061181681674%7Ctwgr%5E291207be03447bee5e559e902954df2f07440686%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10\u0026amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techhut.tv%2Fai-needs-to-deal-with-copyright-laws%2F\nFor images, it’s much harder to spit out a pixel-perfect copy of the training data; however, two studies (1, 2) managed to make Stable Diffusion very closely replicate some of the input images, to the point where it would be a clear infringement to use those outputs. Look at these examples:\nComparison between generated images and matches in the LAION database by the second study mentioned.\nThis seems to be happening, both for code and art, on roughly 1-2% of the outputs. This poses a significant legal risk to whoever uses AI tools too: if (unluckily!) the generated content is a copy from the training data then you might not notice and still be held legally accountable. In fact, Github explicitly says it’s Copilot users’ responsibility to check for any such copyright infringement.\nThere’s more. As I said, we usually can’t download the AI’s models; but Stable Diffusion is a significant exception, releasing everything to the public (which is why it’s often the most studied and mentioned). Recently, researchers have found (and released) a way to fine-tune an existing model on a small set of images (a couple, or some hundreds). This is some additional training but only on a handful of images and makes the model follow that style much more closely. Normally, it would be impossible to replicate the style of specific artists with e.g. Midjourney, unless they’re quite famous. But thanks to Stable Diffusion’s model and this new technique, called “Dreambooth”, we can do that.\nComparison image from the above-mentioned website. Dreambooth, by taking reference images as inputs, allows replicating with great fidelity those input images in new contexts.\nThis might not be legal, though, if you use it to train a model on a specific artist. Since the result of this extra training is a model that follows very specific styles, it directly threatens the original artists, and might not be covered by fair use. However, the responsibility is not on the companies delivering the general models - like Stable Diffusion - but on those people who Dreambooth-train those models on certain artists. One example is the artist Deb JJ Lee, who discovered a Dreambooth model trained on their specific style (and they were not amused by that, to say the least):\nhttps://twitter.com/jdebbiel/status/1601663197031075840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1601663197031075840%7Ctwgr%5E291207be03447bee5e559e902954df2f07440686%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10\u0026amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techhut.tv%2Fai-needs-to-deal-with-copyright-laws%2F\nCan you copyright something you created using AI, by the way? As always for legal matters, it depends on your country. As an example, the UK does allow that, but it’s not exactly clear how or whether the author would be who used the AI or who created it. As far as the US goes, it’s possible to do that as long as there’s still significant human work behind the piece; as an example, through the curation of images, maybe some post-editing, and through actually putting them together. This is how Kristina Kashtanova - author of the AI-generated comic, Zarya Of The Dawn - managed to get US copyright registration, proving that it is indeed possible.\nExample taken from Zarya Of The Dawn.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible\u0026hellip; up to a certain extent. In fact, the copyright has since been partially removed: the US Copyright office has said that Kashtanova “is the author of the Work’s text as well as the selection, coordination, and arrangement of the Work’s written and visual elements” but the images themselves “are not the product of human authorship”.\nNow, we could switch to a more “ethical” side of things, rather than “legal”. Are the current training sets “ethical”? Lots of creators that discovered that their art/text had been used for training purposes were upset about the fact, and it’s clear that there’s no consent from them. Sure, the meaning of “ethic” is very subjective (so you might disagree with the ideas here), but it’s easy to see why it would be best to ask. Let’s talk more about this:\nRight now, there is a call to action for large art-sharing platforms to stop the scraping of art for training purposes. To address this, both DeviantArt and ArtStation introduced a metadata tag that asks AI researchers not to use images for training purposes; of course, this won’t remove existing models already trained on those images, and it’s not clear whether such a metadata tag has any (binding) effect. This is especially true for companies, like OpenAI and Midjourney, who do not release their models or training data and thus cannot be held publicly accountable.\nThere’s another option. Remember LAION, who curates art training data? A group of artists called Spawning created a tool (“Have I Been Trained?”) that searches through its database. They managed to contact Stability AI (who develop Stable Diffusion) and work out a mechanism (whose details are currently unavailable, except for the fact that it works via “LAION tags”) to opt-out images from that training set. Artists can thus make a Spawning account and use their website to ask Stable Diffusion not to be used as training data for the next release, v3.\nOf course, artists would prefer not to be trained by default, with the option to opt-in. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not too clear how that could be implemented.\nCan you create a training set that’s entirely made of images with copyright non-restrictive enough not to be violating them whilst training, regardless of fair use? Considering that we’re talking about billions of images or code files, that might not be easy. There are projects trying to address that. “The Stack” is a 6.8Tb code dataset in 358 different programming languages that can be used for training without breaking their licenses and with the option to opt out of it. However, in the software world, there’s a strong open-source culture; it might not be easy to replicate this feat for art. Also, the quality of the output somewhat depends on the amount of training data: what if we do get a more fair AI art model, but it’s significantly worse than its competitors?\nIt’s clear that something will have to change; and - even though there are various obstacles to these more “ethical” ways to create training data - that might be the most promising direction.\n","date":"March 20, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ai-needs-to-deal-with-copyright-laws/","section":"2023s","summary":"","title":"The Future of AI NEEDS to Deal with Copyright Laws","type":"2023"},{"content":"KDE has managed to port Konsole to Windows 11, and for a good reason; A GNOME Image Viewer application has refactored image decoding, with many user-facing improvements; Meta is considering joining the Fediverse through ActivityPub: there\u0026rsquo;s a lot going on! However, I\u0026rsquo;ll start with a major release (2.0) of a little tool that might come extremely in handy if you have an Android device\u0026hellip;\nYou can now mirror phone audio with scrcpy # The project \u0026ldquo;scrcpy\u0026rdquo; has just released version 2.0! This little tool allows you to use your (Android) phone directly from your computer as if it was a normal window. It allows that both when the device is connected by a cable, but also if the phone in on the same network as your computer (and it works with tablets too). In some specific use cases, it can be a really handy tool!\nSo, what did the update bring? Well, now not only the screen is mirrored, but the audio is as well. This means that all the content playing on the phone - e.g. a Youtube video - will be played on the computer you\u0026rsquo;re using scrcpy from. The feature only works out of the box from Android 12 (and, with some care, on Android 11 too). If you\u0026rsquo;d like to get into the technical details on how this is implemented you can check out the official announcement:\nGnome GTK4 Image Viewer gets new image decoding # \u0026ldquo;Loupe\u0026rdquo; is a Gnome application (currently in their incubator) that\u0026rsquo;s written in GTK4 and has the purpose of - well - viewing images. This week the developer has managed to implement a new image decoding system, which will have a significant impact user-wise. As an example, you\u0026rsquo;re now able to view SVGs and even very large files should have no performance impact on the interface (though there are still a few rendering bugs). In the future, this change will allow for support for color profiles, animated images and - potentially - sandboxed decoding.\nStill this week the application also saw a new design for the thumbnail whilst drag-and-dropping, which now has stronger contrast on the background image. There\u0026rsquo;s also a refactor for the scroll wheel code, rotation and pan gestures on touchscreens, plus many more fixed and improvements. It looks like the application is advancing at lightspeed!\nKDE brings Konsole to Windows # KDE just made sure that Konsole works on Windows too. You might rightfully ask: \u0026ldquo;uh, why?\u0026rdquo;. A first answer, of course, is to allow even users on proprietary operating systems to try out free software applications even before making a full switch to Linux. But, most importantly, there are other KDE apps on Windows - such as Dolphin or Kate - that embed Konsole widgets inside of them. Previously KDE had to use another kind of terminal view that had fewer features but worked in Windows; now, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to directly integrate Konsole. This will make KDE Windows app even better and more appealing!\nIn other KDE news - by the way - another major feature landed: from now on whenever the Wayland crashes Qt applications won\u0026rsquo;t be automatically closed. This makes sure that if you e.g. have unsaved work and Wayland dies then nothing gets lost. Work is ongoing to bring this to other toolkits as well - such as GTK - and this officially crosses off another showstopper for the KDE Wayland transition.\nRounds of Updates for ElementaryOS # After a month from the release of ElementaryOS, there\u0026rsquo;s the first round of updates which - if I understood this correctly - will be published in the next release of ElementaryOS (be it 8 or 7.1). The major focus is the Files application, which now has a menu in the headerbar. This exposes functions like \u0026ldquo;Back\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Forward\u0026rdquo; or zoom controls, as you can see above, that the user might otherwise not know about. Even better, the undo buttons show tooltips that tell you exactly what is going to be undone.\nThe Network Indicator section was also redesigned and now uses a circular toggleable button instead of a list of switches. This allows for a much prettier and more compact design. It also now exposes error states and allows for more than one VPN connection at once.\nOf course, there are more features and bugfixes (especially in window management). You can find the full announcement here:\nMeta is considering joining the Fediverse, somehow # Meta is currently testing - or considering - an application codenamed P92 that would be part of a decentralized text-based network. It\u0026rsquo;s not the first time a major company considers this, see as an example the announcement by Jack Dorsey that Twitter would investigate a way to connect to ActivityPub. However, that has yet to happen. However things could change, given that this P92 app should, in theory, support ActivityPub (which powers the Fediverse, including Mastodon).\nTumblr also has plans to start interacting with the same protocol, according to the CEO. The idea is that you\u0026rsquo;d be able e.g. to crosspost Tumblr posts to Mastodon. Even Flickr is considering using ActivityPub.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links were lost in the migration process.

Firstly there\u0026rsquo;s the announcement of the next version of VanillaOS, which will officially drop Ubuntu to be instead based on Debian. Which, by the way, is also working on their next release, called Bookwork, and which will include Plasma 5.27. The Nitrux has released version 2.7, now offering two different flavors, ditching KDE Plasma in one of the two in favor of Maui Shell.\nOh, and there\u0026rsquo;s some nice news on the next Linux Tablet from Pine64 too\u0026hellip; like the price!\nVanillaOS 2.0 announced dropping Ubuntu # VanillaOS is an immutable distribution that was previously based on Ubuntu; but now, as announced in their blog post (see below), they have decided to switch to Debian. This has many benefits:\nFirstly, Debian is close to a vanilla experience; the developers did try to revert the opinionated workflow changes that Ubuntu introduces, but this proved to be quite time-consuming. Secondly, Debian has \u0026ldquo;no strong opinion on application distribution\u0026rdquo;. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen what Ubuntu is doing, pushing snap even in the various flavors. It seems like VanillaOS core developers do not appreciate this, and prefer to offer something less opinionated. Finally, this gives Vanilla more flexibility in scheduling their releases instead of having to follow Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s.\nThere are some further changes announced too; the next version of Vanilla will ship with GNOME 44 and a 6+ kernel, as an example. The installer now has \u0026ldquo;Express\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Advanced\u0026rdquo; options; the former is straightforward and quick, and the latter is for advanced users who want to tinker with the configs.\nOn a more technical side of things, they are introducing OCI in ABRoots, meaning \u0026ldquo;you will have a more stable and reliable system without compromises\u0026rdquo; because \u0026ldquo;we will have greater control over updates, with more time to test the images before a release\u0026rdquo;.\nEven though Vanilla is extremely new as a distro, it\u0026rsquo;s already shaping up to be a very strong contender!\nNitrux is now offering Maui Shell as an alternative to KDE Plasma # As a quick recap, \u0026ldquo;MauiKit\u0026rdquo; is a framework to create UI that\u0026rsquo;s based on KDE\u0026rsquo;s own framework, \u0026ldquo;Kirigami\u0026rdquo;. Many applications are made by the Maui team using their framework, and they are all part of KDE. The same team also makes a full desktop, called Maui Shell, which is instead not part of KDE.\nNitrux is a distribution that\u0026rsquo;s based on Debian and that uses Appimages as the main way to distribute/install applications. They\u0026rsquo;ve used Maui applications for a lot of time and a very customized KDE Plasma. In their latest release, 2.7, they switched to a custom kernel called \u0026ldquo;Liquorix\u0026rdquo;, updated the version of KDE Plasma they ship to the latest, and also added a \u0026ldquo;Maui\u0026rdquo; variant of the distribution. This version gets rid of KDE Plasma and even Firefox, replacing them with Maui shell and the Fiery Web Browser, both implemented with MauiKit.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty clear that the Nitrux and Maui team is gradually trying to build an alternative to the existing distributions and desktops, building their own thing from scratch; it will be very interesting to see if they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to pull it off!\nDebian 12 and TUXEDO OS 2 will include KDE Plasma 5.27 # A main difference between Debian and Ubuntu to keep in mind when comparing the two, as we did above, is that Debian is quite conservative in what to include in its software repositories. As an example, the current Debian version ships with Plasma 5.20, which is currently seven versions behind (it was released in 2020).\nThe good news is that the next release of Debian, called \u0026ldquo;Bookworm\u0026rdquo;, will include Plasma 5.27, the very latest. Currently, Debian 12 is in soft feature freeze, meaning no big changes can be included. The hard freeze is in just a few days, on the 12th; after that, the schedule is not decided yet. The final release is expected to happen roughly mid-year.\nTalking about TUXEDO OS, the hardware company released publicly the distribution that uses KDE Plasma just five months ago, and now they\u0026rsquo;re back with a new release. TUXEDO OS 2 includes the latest Plasma, 5,27, and the Linux 6 kernel. Other packages were updated as well, such as Mesa, PipeWire, and Mozilla. It does include some custom applications, like the TUXEDO Control Center, that are really meant for TUXEDO computers mainly.\nThe PineTab 2, Linux Tablet, will ship in April at 149$ # The PineTab 2 will be available \u0026ldquo;likely sometime in April\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s the second attempt of Pine64 at making a Linux tablet and, similarly to the first version, it comes with a detachable keyboard cover. There will be two versions: 4GB/64GB, priced at 149$, and 8GB/128GB, priced $209. Good news, the keyboard is included in the price.\nThe author of the Pine blogpost (which is a community-driven project) says that the tablet is \u0026ldquo;certainly the most refined PINE64-branded Linux device thus far\u0026rdquo;, with a metal body and a robust glass LCD panel. Just going by the pictures the hardware quality indeed seems greatly improved compared to the previous version. The cover has a metal hinge on the back that supports the tablet vertically.\nGodot 4.0 released # Godot is a free and open source 2D and 3D game engine, and it\u0026rsquo;s getting quite popular as an alternative to the proprietary Unity or Unreal. The developers have been working on a new major version since four years ago, and it comes packed with (quite technical) features: a modern Vulkan renderer, a new Global Illumination engine, volumetric fog, and so on. If you\u0026rsquo;re a game developer using Godot you should check out the changelog and try out the latest version (which is not yet ready for production, since it has just been released). If you\u0026rsquo;re a game developer not using Godot then this is probably the best time to try it out. If you\u0026rsquo;re not a game developer, well, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time for a career change.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links were lost in the migration process.

Creating top lists for anything is difficult to do, as leaving out bias and opinion is near impossible. An actual top or best Linux distro list would probably have Debian at the top and include OpenSUSE, RHEL, and distributions like that. This list is my favorite Linux distributions I\u0026rsquo;ve used on physical hardware in the last year and find myself returning to.\nhttps://youtu.be/fnNmXhUxa30\nThis will not be ranked necessarily from least to most favorite, but I will rank it from least to most time spent using the distribution. When it comes to ranking, that will be about it.\n5. Vanilla OS # Vanilla OS is what I would consider to be a Linux nerds dream. It\u0026rsquo;s based on Ubuntu, but strips out everything I don\u0026rsquo;t like, including snap and any other Canonical trash. Vanilla OS is an immutable operating system, core parts of the system are read only to prevent unwanted changes and corruption from third-party apps or a bad update. Vinialla used ABRoot creating present and feature states for updates. Most packages will be installed as flatpaks, but you have their own package manger allowing you to install Fedora, or Arch Linux packages inside containers. Learn more\u0026hellip;\n4. KDE Neon # I\u0026rsquo;ve been using the GNOME desktop environment for years now as my desktop environment of choice. That is until I installed KDE Neon on a testing drive to check out some updates. The updates were so good that I found myself booting into KDE Neon than the operating system installed on the main partition.\nKDE Neon is the Ubuntu LTS based distribution shipped by the KDE team themselves, featuring the latest in what they have to offer. KDE Neon is often the first disto to get KDE Plasma updates and I\u0026rsquo;m particularly found of their testing image allowing anyone to get a early preview of the work they\u0026rsquo;re doing. I love KDE Neon because there are no customization or modification beyond what the developers of the desktop environment see fit making this distro one of the best ways to experience Plasma. Learn more\u0026hellip;\n3. SteamOS/HoloISO # Valve\u0026rsquo;s investment in Linux and the popularity of the Steam Deck have been some of the best things for the entire Linux ecosystem recently. SteamOS for the Steam Deck is an Arch-based Linux distro built around Steam\u0026rsquo;s big picture mode, giving users a console experience while still giving access to a full Linux environment with the KDE Plasma desktop. HoloISO is a rebuilt version of the Steam Deck recovery image, allowing the software to be installed on other systems.\nMy first experience with this was installing HoloISO on a mini-PC and using it as a living room gaming console, which is still set up and working great. My love for this exploded once I actually got the hardware it was intended for. Valve had a wonderful experience with the menus and the system\u0026rsquo;s fluidity. Even integrations with some Linux tools, such as GOverlay, are built into their Performance Overlay under battery settings. Honestly, this is my favorite implementation of Linux at a normal consumer level. Absolutely amazing. Learn more\u0026hellip;\n2. Ubuntu Server # Setting away from the consumer level we have probably the most boring item on this list and that is Ubuntu Server. I am no fan of Ubuntu desktop, but their server adition has never done me wrong. Whenever I need to spin up a service in Proxmox I pick Ubuntu Server as goes for needing a server distro on hardware or even spinning up something on Linode. I\u0026rsquo;m just so use to using it and when it comes to the terminal I am familiar with alot of the packages that Ubuntu server ships and how to use them. Overall, it a mixture of familiarity and efficiency for me as when I use other systems I find myself on forums or guides a lot more when needing to figure something out. Performance is top notch, package availability is there, it\u0026rsquo;s just a great system. Other than the Synology NAS I have it basically powers everything in my homelab. Learn more\u0026hellip;\n1. Nobara Linux # Oh Nobara, I love you so. I started using Nobara full time in the summer of 2022 and it has been my main system ever since. I was using the GNOME version for a while, but in the last few months I switched over to their KDE edition after spending some time checking out KDE Neon. Nobara is basically Fedora (my favorite desktop os) but with a bunch of tweaks and improvements that really do make a difference in what I do. There are a bunch of kernal patches for better hardware support, nvidia optimizations, latest mesa drivers, fractional scaling patches, OBS Studio improvements and a whole lot more. Nobara Linux fixes many of the issues that I\u0026rsquo;ve had installing Linux on hardware such as gaming laptops that are often difficult with a stock Fedora installation. Hell, then even have out of the box support for DaVinci Resolve which is often a pain to setup on AMD machines. Learn more\u0026hellip;\nHonorable Mentions # Pop!_OS # I found it difficult to not include Pop!_OS in this list as it is a great system, but at the moment most of their resources is going to their new desktop environment written in rust. It should be coming out sometime this year and I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward to trying it out. Learn more\u0026hellip;\nEndeavourOS # Before Nobara and Fedora I was using EndeavourOS. Nothing caused me to switch away other than to try something new.

Firstly, the HP Dev One (an ultrabook from HP that shipped with Linux out of the box) has been discontinued. The company stopped selling the device in January and has no plan to create a new model; it could be that not enough Dev Ones were sold to justify the project in HP\u0026rsquo;s eyes. It was the only computer, apart from System76 hardware, to ship with Pop!_OS.\nThis comes at rather unfortunate timing since at the end of January we also saw Mycroft claim that they\u0026rsquo;ll have to cease development entirely by the end of February unless they received more funding. No update has been published since then; however, the Mark II - an Amazon Echo open-source alternative, that used Mycroft AI assistant - also announced they would not be able to ship the device to all the backers that financially supported the project; it turned out that the manufacturing costs were three times higher (100$ → 300$) than initially expected. It seems like this is yet another story of open-source hardware making that\u0026rsquo;s sadly coming to an end.\nThe future of Flathub as the Linux software center # The KDE e.V. and GNOME Foundation made a proposal to PlaintextGroup to ask for 100.000$ in funding, with the explicit goal of making Flathub the \u0026ldquo;Linux App Store\u0026rdquo;. One main goal of this proposal would be to introduce some (privacy-respecting) monetization aspects to the platform, such as the ability to sell applications and set up a recurring donation or subscription system. Also planned is tooling to review applications, to make sure they do not have misleading names, descriptions, or such.\nCoincidentally around the same days, though, Flathub also got a major brand redesign. Jakub Steiner, from the GNOME community, published a blogpost with a new visual identity of the project. As a logo we no longer have multiple boxes joined together, but rather four small icons: a circle, a triangle, a square, and a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo;. The author also published two wallpapers created using the same shape and patterns of the new Flathub logo.\nWindows 11 will add a watermark on unsupported hardware # If your computer does not meet Windows 11 minimum hardware requirements a watermark will appear on the bottom right of the screen. This is particularly controversial as the requirements are quite strict, only accepting Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen+ and Zen 2 CPUs and up. This has left millions of PC behind, and many used workarounds to upgrade to Windows 11 anyway. Previously this only resulted in a warning in System Settings; now, that warning will always be on the bottom right of the screen, without any option to disable it.\nThe FBI is recommending to use ad blockers to avoid online fraud # With a public announcement titled \u0026ldquo;Cyber Criminals Impersonating Brands Using Search Engine Advertisement Services to Defraud Users\u0026rdquo;, the FBI described a type of scam that happens when an ad impersonates websites, even financial ones (\u0026ldquo;particularly cryptocurrency exchange platforms\u0026rdquo;). These will ask users for their financial information and will use them to steal their funds. Interestingly enough, in the \u0026ldquo;Tips to Protect Yourself\u0026rdquo; section, we have can see \u0026ldquo;Use an ad blocking extension when performing internet searches\u0026rdquo;.\nThe GNOME Circle is a big success # The GNOME Circle is a set of applications designed for GNOME which passed a certain quality check to obtain promotion and advertising from the GNOME team and such; it\u0026rsquo;s a win-win situation: the GNOME projects gets to give direct quality feedback to the applications, which can then reach a wider audience through the project. This week, the Circle project has officially reached its 50th onboarded application, with three new entries.\nThe first one is \u0026ldquo;Chess Clock\u0026rdquo;, which \u0026ldquo;allows you to time games of over-the-board chess\u0026rdquo;. The second one is Komikku, which \u0026ldquo;allows you to read your favorite manga\u0026rdquo;. Finally we have \u0026ldquo;Eyedropper\u0026rdquo; which \u0026ldquo;allows you to pick colors and generate palettes\u0026rdquo;.\nOf course, there\u0026rsquo;s progress in applications using GNOME technologies even outside the Circle project. As an example, we have a new application called \u0026ldquo;Elastic\u0026rdquo; which allows developers to visually edit spring animations for UI elements, \u0026ldquo;Mousai\u0026rdquo; (an application that allows recognizing songs by listening to them) now works offline, \u0026ldquo;Paleta\u0026rdquo; (an application that extracts colorschemes from images) has released a new major version completely rewritten in Rust, and \u0026ldquo;Capsule\u0026rdquo; (a reminder application for medications) has released a new version supporting mobile form factors.\nKDE Plasma Master git branch is now on Qt 6 # This means that, from now on, any developer that builds KDE Plasma from source will get, by default, Plasma built on Qt 6. This is the next generation of the Qt graphical toolkit used by KDE; the first release with Qt 6 will be, unsurprisingly enough, KDE Plasma 6. Thus, the development of the new version of KDE Plasma is going forward and we can expect the big release to be towards the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024.\nMeanwhile, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work going on to further improve multi-monitor setups. Since 5.27 boosted a significantly better experience with them, more users started trying out the feature, leading to more niche bug reports that are now being addressed by the developers. There\u0026rsquo;s also a new nice feature (that will be published in Plasma 6) already: if you try to set an image as wallpaper by right click, you\u0026rsquo;ll now be able to choose whether you want it set as desktop, lockscreen, or both.\nFinally, two KDE applications received significant visual improvements: the Welcome Center, which now has the \u0026ldquo;Prev\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; buttons at the bottom as many users requested, and Discover (which is getting prettier by the day!).\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links were lost in the migration process.

Then, a blogpost by the maintainer of CoreJS where he says that the current state of Open Source has been widely discussed in Linux communities. Finally, Gnome and KDE shared their latest implemented new features and redesigns.\nPurisms introduces the \u0026ldquo;Lapdock Kit\u0026rdquo; # One of the main features of most Linux phone OSs is \u0026ldquo;Convergency\u0026rdquo;; the idea is that, by simply plugging your phone into a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, it should become a full desktop. Given that the phone is powerful enough to support this use case, this does seem quite appealing (in fact, Android implements a very similar feature).\nPurism has decided to start selling a kit that allows you to experience convergence using a laptop shell. The \u0026ldquo;computer\u0026rdquo; you see in the above picture has no CPU nor RAM, it simply uses the phone for all of that (in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s more of a docking station). The kit comes with a \u0026ldquo;Lapdock\u0026rdquo; (the laptop shell, called Nexdock 360), a mount for the phone, and a cable to connect the two. The Lapdock supports a full hinge rotation, potentially making it a tablet as well.\nKubuntu Focus introduces the 2nd generation of the Focus NX # Kubuntu Focus is a company that sells Linux hardware with (you guessed it) Kubuntu pre-installed. Their main goal is to make sure the software is perfectly compatible with the hardware and has no issues out of the box. They have just announced their second generation of the compact Linux computer \u0026ldquo;Focus NX\u0026rdquo;. This comes with 12th-generation Intel cores (12 of them), Iris Xe Graphis, and 35W TDP. Wi-Fi 6E is now supported by the computer, alongside Bluetooth 5.3. As far as ports go, you now have two Thunderbolt 4, two HDMI 2.1, and two DisplayPort 1.4 through USB-C.\nCoreJS maintainer calls for help # CoreJS is a Javascript poly filling library that\u0026rsquo;s used by roughly 75% of the top 100 websites, and roughly 50% of the top 1000. It is maintained by a single person that has worked full-time on it since 2014. He was so fond of the library that he decided to leave his high-paying job to work on CoreJS purely based on donations (roughly 2.500$/mo). However, the revenue stream has decreased significantly since then (to 1700$/mo), and due to the sanctions on Russia (where he lives) he\u0026rsquo;s now unable to collect most of that, with only 700$/mo remaining.\nEven worse, he got into a car accident and was asked to pay (unlawfully, he claims) about 80 thousand dollars. Unable to do so, he had to live one year in prison and was only released in 2021. He tried to set up a fundraising message that would appear each time a developer would install CoreJS, however, this only brought him an additional 37$/mo and a significant amount of hate and insults from other developers.\nHis blog post is quite long and deep, and has been covered by many news articles and videos; at the end of it, he says that he\u0026rsquo;s unable to live in this situation and either the revenue stream increases significantly or he\u0026rsquo;ll have to stop working on the project.\nGnome\u0026rsquo;s doing redesigns # In their latest weekly blog post, the Gnome community has showcased a couple of redesigns that were recently completed. Firstly, we have the \u0026ldquo;Mouse \u0026amp; Touchpad\u0026rdquo; settings page. Now you can see animations to explain what certain settings do, it has a new design for the \u0026ldquo;Pointer Assistance\u0026rdquo; dialog, and is just prettier.\nSecondly, there are improvements to the quick settings that were introduced in the latest version of Gnome. Firstly, the Bluetooth section now has an arrow that shows you all available Bluetooth connections (meaning you can pair a device even without opening settings). Secondly, each button now has a brief subtitle that tells you e.g. the current Wi-Fi network name, Bluetooth-connected device, etc. Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s a new option to see the list of apps running in the background (that is, apps that do not have a window).\nThe Console tab section was also redesigned; you do get a \u0026ldquo;Show All Tabs\u0026rdquo; option that will, well, show a grid of previews of all open tabs. This is the default tab view when Console is used on a small size, e.g. a phone. Finally, a new feature that landed this week is a dialog in the Gnome Wi-Fi settings to display a QR code (you can just scan it to connect any other device to the same network).\nKDE Plasma 6 work has started # Given that Plasma 5.27 - the last Plasma 5 release - is out, all changes implemented from now on will be released in Plasma 6. Thus, work has started! As an example, the flatpak page of any installed application in Discover will now show a \u0026ldquo;Configure permissions\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; button that will directly open Flatpak Permissions in System Settings. You can also now customize how permissions should be shown in Dolphin (options are symbolic, numeric, or both). Dolphin is also now faster at counting the size of directories (especially remote ones). Gwenview has smooth zooming, the Weather Report widget shows wind speed and humidity in the tooltip and some other small changes. You won\u0026rsquo;t see any new big features as the team is currently working on fixing any regression or bug raised from the recent release.\nAll Ubuntu Flavors drop Flatpaks # Ubuntu developers have decided to drop Flatpak out of the box on any Ubuntu flavor. They justify this by saying that this will \u0026ldquo;improve the out-of-the-box Ubuntu experience\u0026rdquo; by making it clearer what an \u0026ldquo;Ubuntu experience\u0026rdquo; is. Flatpak will still be offered in Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s repositories, but the users will have to install it manually to use it. This is quite a controversial choice that has sparked some discussion, especially since it affects any Ubuntu flavor. It would be interesting the thoughts of the various Ubuntu flavor leads.\nNotice: This is an older newsletter; many links were lost in the migration process.

Click this link for an archive of the old newsletter site.\nThis week saw the release of KDE Plasma 5.27 and EndlessOS 5. Aside from these two, we\u0026rsquo;ll cover the improvements that GNOME and Thunderbird are receiving, and also how Microsoft Bing could be threatening OpenStreetMap community model with its own map editor.\nKDE releases the last Plasma 5 version # KDE has released Plasma 5.27, the last version before Plasma 6 (which should be ready later this year). New in this release: there\u0026rsquo;s a welcome application that will appear on the first boot to introduce users to how Plasma works; it also allows for some customization, e.g. turning on KUserFeedback.\nPlasma 5.27 also comes with a built-in tiling system. By pressing meta+t you can access a tiling zones view; after spending some time customizing what these should be, dragging a window when pressing shift will automatically tile it to the closest window area. Ideally, this could be extended in the future via its API by third-party scripts.\nSystem Settings are a bit cleaner out of the box with the removal of the \u0026ldquo;Highlight Changed Settings\u0026rdquo; button (now in the menubar) and of some now-unnecessary pages. Discover (KDE\u0026rsquo;s app center) homepage was also redesigned to showcase popular apps (chosen dynamically).\nThis version also comes with a complete rewrite of the multi-monitor code. If you previously experienced bugs when using more than one display, make sure to test whether that was fixed. Various other changes can be found in the full announcement:\nEndlessOS 5.0 Stable Released # EndlessOS is an immutable distribution that comes with lots of pre-installed applications and is meant to be extremely simple to use (be it for work, or for educational purposes). It uses GNOME as a shell and the developers are also active in upstreaming changes; as an example, the performance improvements I\u0026rsquo;ll mention down below in this newsletter are from this project.\nThe latest release updates the desktop to GNOME 41, comes with more applications in the Flatpak format to allow you to uninstall them if not needed, and uses the integrated graphic card out of the box for non-GPU-demanding applications to save battery life on laptops.\nThunderbird shares a plan to rebuild the interface from scratch # In the planned Thunderbird 115 release of this year, a new redesign should land (named \u0026ldquo;Supernova\u0026rdquo;). In their latest blogpost, the Product Design manager explains how and why they\u0026rsquo;re tackling the task. As an example, it\u0026rsquo;s explained how Thunderbird is \u0026ldquo;literally a bunch of code running on top of Firefox\u0026rdquo;; and although it\u0026rsquo;s useful to use many of Firefox technologies as a base (Gecko web rendered, Spidermonkey JS compiler, \u0026hellip;) this comes with a significant maintenance burden and code complexity. Whenever something changes upstream, anything could be break (C++ interfaces, APIs, etc) at the Thunderbird level.\nIn the same blogpost Thunderbird says that the project is currently sustainable with a healthy donation flow, but services are in development to increase the revenue stream. Coming up, they say, is also a blogpost that will explain how the redesign will fit nicely too with users who don\u0026rsquo;t want to change their existing workflows.\nGNOME\u0026rsquo;s working on better performance # In the past week, we got more insight into how GNOME is improving its performance via a blogpost by a contributor working exactly on that. The main tool is profiling, which was introduced in 2018 and is described as a \u0026ldquo;massive tsunami that took the GNOME community\u0026rdquo;. The more recent progress was achieved by extending the profiling tools currently used for the Software Center; by doing that, the contributor noticed that 3 of the 3.6 seconds the app needed to display its content were due to loading icons.\nWhat was going on behind the scenes is that some applications defined remote icons with incorrect/dead URLs, and the Software Center was wasting a considerable amount of time on those before timing out. Just by making that asynchronous, performance increased significantly.\nMeanwhile, GNOME has also just merged a feature that allows users to see what applications are running in the background (that is, without any visible window). This is done by adding an \u0026ldquo;x apps are running in the background\u0026rdquo; indicator in the System Tray, which expands to show the app names when clicked.\nMicrosoft Bing threatens OpenStreetMap, according to contributor # As a bit of context, OpenStreetMap is a collective work brought forward by lots of individual contributors in a very similar manner to Wikipedia. All of the map data is then distributed freely with a share-alike license that requires attribution. There are various editors that allow anybody to create an OSM account and contribute to the accuracy of the map data. Mid 20202, Microsoft published a website called \u0026ldquo;Bing Map Builder\u0026rdquo; that works as another editor to OSM data. This could be an interesting way to get even more people to contribute to the project, but there are various issues with it.\nAs an example, an important part of contributing to OSM is the ability to collaborate with other users. Bing Map Builder creates a proxy account for each user that uses random letters as username, currently does not notify users in case they receive messages, and disallows using Bing Map Builder accounts on other OpenStreetMap editors (whereas all other OSM editors are interoperable). An OSM contributor has published a very detailed blogpost to share his worries on this approach from Bing.\n","date":"February 15, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2023/02/kde-plasma-527-endless-5/","section":"2023s","summary":"","title":"KDE Plasma 5.27 \u0026 EndlessOS 5 released, Thunderbird future plans, and more!","type":"2023"},{"content":"Notice: This is an older newsletter; many links were lost in the migration process. Click this link for an archive of the old newsletter site.\nThis last week saw major releases of various projects, featuring Elementary, LibreOffice, and the KDE Mobile Gear (which includes lots of KDE apps to be used on desktop too). Other projects, like Servo and COSMIC, published blogposts with their in-progress work and future plans.\nElementaryOS 7 Released # One year after release 6.1, there\u0026rsquo;s a new version of Elementary. Most of the changes focused on the experience of using the App Store, which improved significantly. There\u0026rsquo;s a better design that gives more focus to apps\u0026rsquo; screenshots, links to resolved issues in the apps\u0026rsquo; repository (to show whether development is active), optional support for automatic updates, and better support for sideloaded apps (e.g. flatpaks).\nOther applications also received redesigns; the Email client was significantly improved, Tasks added support for managing offline events (to sync when network is available), and the Files application supports single-click-to-select behavior. The Music application was completely rewritten to address user feedback; now, it works better as a tool to preview audio files quickly but is also improved for those who curate a local collection of music.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more than that, covering redesigned system settings pages, new settings (e.g. sunset to sunrise colorschemes), new icons, a new developer application to browse existing icons, and so on. You can check the full announcement here:\nLibreOffice 7.5 Released, with new pretty icons # LibreOffice has recently released a new major version of its suite. The easiest change to notice are the new icons, which use the apps\u0026rsquo; accent color for the entire icon background instead of just a thin outline. In the screenshot above, the first group is standard icons, the second group is for mime types (for saved files), the third one is MacOS-specific. Though design is often subjective, I think the new icons feel significantly more modern than the previous ones!\nThe release also brought improvements to dark mode in the form of more than 40 various bugfixes; the Start Center - which shows all of your recent documents - can now filter them by type. The \u0026ldquo;Single Toolbar\u0026rdquo; design was also re-implemented, and now supports being customized. Finally, it seems like Writer is getting initial support for machine learning translation through DeepL\u0026rsquo;s API. Check out the full changelog here:\nServo publishes a roadmap for 2023 # Servo is a project that aims to build a modular and independent (open-source) web engine. It was initially developed by Mozilla and shares code with Firefox; however, the company stopped its development in 2020. In the same year, the project was transferred to the Linux Foundation. The project is now working at getting some traction back; that explains why the first two items of the roadmap are \u0026ldquo;Project Reactivation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Outreach\u0026rdquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s surely a project that will require quite some time to be production-ready, but it could be a significant help in democratizing the web if it succeeds.\nXfce is working hard on Wayland support # Work for the Xfce 4.20 started earlier this month with the release of the new package libxfce4windowing, which aims to provide Wayland support of the desktop. Then, Xfce display manager (xfdesktop) was ported to Wayland as well, together with the desktop\u0026rsquo;s panel. It\u0026rsquo;s very early work, as the release will probably be ready by the end of 2024; but, if everything goes right, that might the first release with full Wayland support. Still, the next version of Xfce is 4.19, so the development is currently happening for that version.\nUpdate on COSMIC DE development by System76 # System76 is currently working on building its own desktop environment in Rust, called COSMIC. They have recently published a blogpost explaining what they\u0026rsquo;ve been working on in the last month. It\u0026rsquo;s a good occasion to see what design the team is going for. As an example, segmented buttons were recently introduced. The team has also shared figma mockups of various System Settings pages that are currently in development, containing annotations and interactive elements too. Some pages are very detailed; as an example, here you can find various mockups of the sound section of Settings.\nAlong these design improvements and plans, there\u0026rsquo;s also more technical stuff. As an example, there\u0026rsquo;s now a dynamic (OpenGL/Vulkan/Softbuffer) renderer of iced (the graphical toolkit of the new desktop). There\u0026rsquo;s also improvements on text rendering, XWayland, and more:\nPlasma Mobile releases Gear 23.01 and works on Plasma Mobile 5.27 # To clarify the title, Plasma Mobile applications and the actual shell have different release schedules. The Gear, of which a new version was just released, includes the applications. To get the latest changes of the actual shell we\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait for the Plasma 5.27 release on the 14th of January (which will include the Desktop improvements too).\nChanges in the latest Gear release include a complete redesign - even under the hood - of PlasmaTube, a KDE client for Youtube. As an example, it\u0026rsquo;s now possible to have a video running whilst browsing other videos (similarly to Youtube\u0026rsquo;s official application). Alligator, the RSS app, now better supports wide-screen layout (tablet/desktop) by having a three-column design. Kasts, the podcast app, was also redesigned and now has a pretty blurred header that shows the currently playing podcast; it also comes with a complete backend change, for more reliable streaming. There\u0026rsquo;s a new application for EPUB viewing too, which has been developed by Carl and myself, called Arianna. It already supports adding a library and searching through books.\nThese are just a few changes; significant improvements also landed on AudioTube (Youtube Music Player), Neochat (Matrix Client), Tokodon (Mastodon Client), Kalc (Calculator), Spacebar (SMS/MMS app). Even better, all of these applications are available and designed both for Plasma Mobile and desktop usage.\n","date":"February 7, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2023/02/new-elementary-libreoffice-and-kde-apps/","section":"2023s","summary":"","title":"Releases for Elementary, LibreOffice, KDE Apps, and more!","type":"2023"},{"content":" Troubles for Open Source Software at the European Commission # On the 15th of September 2022, the European Commission has published the European Cyber Resilience Act. The goal is to have a common set of cybersecurity standards that would be able to avoid up to €180-290 billion annually. There\u0026rsquo;s just an issue: it might have a big impact on the Open Source world.\nThe proposal would require software developers to guarantee the security of their products \u0026ldquo;throughout the whole life cycle\u0026rdquo;, to offer a \u0026ldquo;coherent cybersecurity framework\u0026rdquo;, to improve the transparency of digital security, and to \u0026ldquo;use products with digital elements securely\u0026rdquo;. All of this is expected to have a compliance cost for the software developers; a cost that many Open Source projects might not be able to afford.\nThe Act is currently in a \u0026ldquo;call for feedback\u0026rdquo; phase until the 23rd of January. The Open Source Initiative has submitted feedback asking for “further work on the Open Source exception to the requirements within the body of the Act”. As an example, responsibility for compliance could be required only for actors that are commercial beneficiaries of the deployment. Olaf Kolkman, exec lead advisor for the Internet Society, also said that \u0026ldquo;the regulation should be modified to make it clear that software produced under an open source license and distributed on not-for-profit basis is out of scope for the regulation”.\nThe Act will go through a negotiating phase for the coming months, with EU Ministers expected to report on the progress at the beginning of June.\nA new immutable Distro that blends Fedora, Ubuntu, and Arch # You\u0026rsquo;ve never seen this many different neofetches in a single OS.\nMade by the developer Rudra Saraswat (also the author of Ubuntu Unity, Ubuntu Web, UbuntuX, and more) we have a new immutable distribution that - though formally based on Arch - can run dnf/yum and apt and pacman and yay.\nBlendOS running multiple package managers.\nOf course, Flatpaks are also supported; BlendOS also has a tool to switch between desktop environments (or window managers). Similarly to Vanilla and NitruxOS, this is managed through distrobox, which installs the packages in a container and then exposes them to the system.\nThe installer of the system is made using Jade GUI, which was developed by Crystal Linux (a Arch based distribution) with the goal of being a simple, pretty installer. And they nailed it.\nInterestingly enough, this is only the third distribution going in this immutable-via-distrobox direction, after the above-mentioned NitruxOS and Vanilla. The latter has managed to get a lot of popularity very quickly, showing that there\u0026rsquo;s actual interest in this new idea of distribution.\nFedora developer introduces a new way to test the latest KDE # A screenshot of Fedora Kinoite Nightly.\nFedora was one of the first to introduce immutable distributions, though with a different approach. The KDE variant of Fedora\u0026rsquo;s immutable distro, Kinoite, now has a new (unofficial) version, called Nightly. The idea is very similar to KDE Neon: being able to ship to users the git master version of KDE Plasma and Apps, mostly for development or testing purposes. However, Kinoite Nightly does it on an immutable basis, which makes it significantly less prone to breakages compared to Neon.\nThis comes timely, as the last version of KDE Plasma 5 (before the 6 series) is currently in beta testing. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in helping out the project, testing this new distribution might be a good way.\nGnome 44 Alpha Released, preparing for release in March # Since we\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned how you can help KDE by testing the beta, it would be unfair to also mention that Gnome has also recently started public testing for their next version, which will be released on the 22th of March.\nGnome 44 will feature Ephipani - Gnome\u0026rsquo;s Browser - ported to GTK4, grid view (with previews!) for the file chooser dialog, a Bluetooth sub-menu in the Quick Settings and a redesigned Accessibility panel. System settings can also now share Wi-Fi passwords via QR Codes, the Date \u0026amp; Time panel is more mobile-friendly, and you can see kernel and firmware versions in the about page.\nMeawhile, we also have very interesting work going on regarding the mobile efforts, which are currently split between Phosh - a shell specifically made for mobile phones - and Gnome itself, natively running on such devices. On phosh side, they\u0026rsquo;ve increased the number of testcases; These also take screenshots in various languages whilst being run, allowing the developers to check that no string gets cut regardless of the system language.\nFinally, developer Cassidy Blaede has published a video of Gnome running on a OnePlus 6T with experimental patches (not merged yet). It shows the main functions of Gnome working (almost) flawlessly: taking screenshots by selecting area, quick settings, and notifications, and switching between open applications using gestures.\nAnyone can now get Ubuntu Pro for free # Canonical has recently announced that their Ubuntu Pro service is now available to anyone with up to five machines. Quick recap on what Pro is: whilst Ubuntu LTS delivers security patches to Ubuntu Main packages for up to five years, Ubuntu Pro doubles that to 10 years of support, and also adds 10 years of patches to all packages in the much-bigger Ubuntu Universe repository. Other features of Pro include being able to live-patch the Kernel. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this extended period of support for your packages (maybe because you need very high stability) you might be interested in this version.\n","date":"January 31, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2023/01/eu-act-immutable-distros/","section":"2023s","summary":"","title":"New EU Act poses risks for FOSS, new Immutable Distros, and more!","type":"2023"},{"content":" A sneak peek to Unity 7.7 # New proposed sidebar look for Unity 7.7\nRudra Saraswat, the maintainer of Ubuntu Unity, has published a blogpost asking for feedback on the upcoming version of the Unity desktop. He showcased many of the changes that the update will bring, starting from a new widget system called UWidgets. This will allow adding some custom information on the desktop itself, similar to what Plasma offers too. The widgets can be written in Python and will have access to some elements of the desktop itself, such as the wallpaper and dock. Finally, all of this will be available on an online store offered by Unity itself. Another significant change is the new look for the dash, which you can see in the picture. It\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be the final appearance, though they say feedback is still welcome. There will also be a new Welcome app written in Flutter (a very interesting choice!). The app will explain what the Unity project is and allow you to get started with it, though we don\u0026rsquo;t know any details yet. Finally, the panel also gets a revamp in its looks, also covering accessibility and usability improvements to the notification section of the desktop. Unity does seem very alive!\nNew release of Vanilla OS # VanillaOS wallpapers.\nVanillaOS is a new kind of distribution that quickly got very popular. The main features it offers are an on-demand immutable system, atomic updates, installing apps in containers, etc. The package manager that deals with containers is called apx; previously, it only supported containers with the same OS as the host, Ubuntu. However, you now get the ability to quickly create, through --aur and --dnf flags, Arch Linux and Fedora systems. In both cases, the packages will be integrated with the host system. This release also features a tool called VSO (Vanilla System Operator) that checks for the best time to download new updates in the background depending on CPU usage, battery left, and more. The changes will then be applied on the next boot through ABRoot, which will revert everything if the update goes wrong, to make sure the system is kept stable. VanillaOS 22.10 uses Ubuntu Kinetic as a base and features GNOME 43; it also brings new wallpapers.\nNitrux 2.6 release removes apt # Another distribution that is going in the path of installing packages through a container is Nitrux; actually, it uses the same technology as Vanilla\u0026rsquo;s apx (that is, distrobox). The approach seems to be more explicit than Vanilla\u0026rsquo;s, as you have to manually create the distrobox, install the application, and then expose it to the host system. Other recommended ways to install applications are App Images and Flatpaks. Other changes featured in this release of Nitrux are the inclusion of the PulseAudio Equalizer and the re-organization of KDE\u0026rsquo;s System Monitor. Nitrux ships with the latest version of the KDE Plasma desktop and uses MAUI applications on top of that. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that Nitrux heavily customizes Plasma, in a way that\u0026rsquo;s very similar to the new Maui shell. It would be no surprise if, when that desktop is more mature, KDE Plasma would be ditched entirely by the distro.\nBy the way, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in this project, you might also want to check out the latest report published by the Maui team. It includes all the new features and bugfixes to the application used in Nitrux; as an example, the image viewer (Pix) can now perform searches in the images with OCR, and can extract the text as well, similarly to Google Lens. There\u0026rsquo;s also a new application entirely, Era, that\u0026rsquo;s a clock application. Right now it\u0026rsquo;s quite a barebone, but it has just been announced.\nA \u0026ldquo;Limited Edition\u0026rdquo; Linux workstation from Slimbook # Slimbook has decided to end the year by announcing a limited edition of their Kymera Ventus AMD computer, featuring AMD CPUs and black coating. This limited edition also has Tux on the front and ships with Kubuntu out of the box, though you can choose different distros too (such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc). The price starts at 1999€ for the model with: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU, AMD RX Radeon 6750 XT Graphics, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and no storage.\nPurism tries to solve Linux phones camera troubles # A picture taken from the Librem 5, a Linux phone.\nIt is no great secret that camera quality in Linux phones is not great. One of the very first applications to take pictures was \u0026ldquo;Megapixels\u0026rdquo;, written in Python with GTK and currently maintained in the postmarketOS repository. Purism has decided to fork that application into a new one, \u0026ldquo;Millipixels\u0026rdquo;, bringing significant improvements; the biggest ones are the automatic focus, support for video recordings, and automatic adjustment of exposure. A lot of the quality of the image taken in mobile phones relies on post-processing by the camera application, so it\u0026rsquo;s quite significant that Purism is investing in this area. Of course, they do this because they have their own Linux phone, the Librem 5. However, according to them, it should be easy enough to port their changes onto other phones. Another attempt at improving the situation is the libcamera project, an \u0026ldquo;an open source camera stack [\u0026hellip; which] aims to control the complexity of embedded camera hardware by providing an intuitive API and method of separating untrusted vendor code from the open source core.\u0026rdquo;.\nSwitch to Mastodon with Tokodon # Tokodon, a client for Mastodon (/Pleroma/Nextcloud Social), has just announced a new version. This client is part of the KDE offering, and it\u0026rsquo;s developed with Kirigami. In the latest version, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a complete redesign of the timeline to make it cleaner and easier to visually parse, the implementation of the search functionality (for posts, accounts, etc), the ability to see all posts that include a certain hashtag, a dedicated view with all private conversations, the ability to see and vote on polls, edit your account\u0026rsquo;s information, and more. If you were planning on switching to Mastodon and needed an application that integrates with your system style, this might be it!\n","date":"January 10, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2023/01/vanilla-os-tokodon/","section":"2023s","summary":"","title":"Vanilla OS release, Tokodon client, Unity, and more!","type":"2023"},{"content":"Welcome to the new year! News is lighter this go around. Feel free to share with your friends! I hope you all have a great start to the year.\nLinux market share is rising! # There are more and more people using Linux daily, and we can see that in various metrics. This first one - though undoubtedly biased - is in StackOverflow\u0026rsquo;s developer survey. Since they\u0026rsquo;re done every year, we can use them to see the trend in Linux usage. In the past five years, it has always been around 25% (again, amongst developers, which is not representative of the general population). This year that number has skyrocketed to 40.23%. Even better, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider people using WSL or Linux VMs.\nResults of StackOverflow\u0026rsquo;s developer survey about operating systems.\nSecondly, we can see the impact of the SteamDeck on Valve\u0026rsquo;s Steam Survey. Just a few years ago, Linux was used by 0.8% of the survey participants. For reference, macOS is currently at 2.45%. There has been a steady increase in Linux in the last few years, but November\u0026rsquo;s data saw a clear increase, reaching 1.44%, a record. We\u0026rsquo;re still talking about small numbers, but there\u0026rsquo;s a clear improvement. So, if you\u0026rsquo;re a fan - as I am - of more and more people using Linux, this is some exciting news!\nAmongst other features, GNOME claims world domination # Actual graph from GNOME\u0026rsquo;s weekly blogpost.\nThe last GNOME weekly blog post ends with a funny note, where GNOME claims that - after finally introducing file previews in the GTK file chooser - Linux market share is now higher than any other operating system, officially making 2022 the Year Of The Linux Desktop. Jokes aside, we have a complete redesign of the audio testing dialog in system settings:\nNew look for the audio testing dialog in GNOME\u0026rsquo;s System Settings.\nAlso, there\u0026rsquo;s a new component to LibAdwaita (which is a UI library that contains various \u0026ldquo;widgets\u0026rdquo; to use in GTK applications). This component is called \u0026ldquo;Banner\u0026rdquo; and looks like a Dialog with some context information. Improvements in third-party GNOME projects include: Graph - an application to plot graphs and manipulate data, written with LibAdwaita - reaches FlatHub, we have a new version of Live Captions - to help out with accessibility -, phosh can now display emergency contact information on the lockscreen.\nKDE land: Gwenview touchpad gestures \u0026amp; the fundraising # The proposed new look of the renaming dialog.\nThese days not much is happening in KDE due to the Christmas break, but there are nonetheless some improvements. The most significant is, when using Wayland, that you can now use the pinch touchpad gesture to zoom in and out of pictures. Nowadays, this is the standard for image viewers! KDE is improving its touchpad gestures in general, and it\u0026rsquo;s nice to see these improvements come to applications too. Another improvement that\u0026rsquo;s not done yet is the prettifying of batch renaming when using dolphin; you can see the new WIP in the picture above. A blogpost by developer Kai Uwe explains everything that he\u0026rsquo;s working on and that he worked on in 2022. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that KDE is running an end-of-the-year fundraising campaign; or should I say \u0026ldquo;was\u0026rdquo;, since the goal (20.000€) was reached (which is great news for the organization!). This is particularly important since it\u0026rsquo;s one of the first KDE fundraisings in recent times and comes together with the first hiring of a developer.\nThe Linux Foundations aims at interoperable open map data # The Linux Foundation has teamed up with big companies like Meta, Microsoft and AWS to launch the \u0026ldquo;Overture Maps Foundation\u0026rdquo;. The goal is to create interoperable open map data, in an attempt to provide some competition to Google\u0026rsquo;s proprietary maps. In the organization, we can also find the Dutch mapping company TomTom. The project seems to be rather similar to Open Street Map, a collaborative project with open data as a goal; however, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear how these two will interoperate. A possible criticism of OSM that might worry big companies is that - being partly user editable - it\u0026rsquo;s rather complex to assure that all the map data is indeed correct and reflects the real world. Currently, we can only wait and see how this turns out; it does seem to be a promising project, though.\nFOSS Support for JPEG-XL increases as Darktable 4.2 is released # JPEG-XL support seems to be a controversial topic after Google decided to ditch it entirely from its Chrome/Chromium browsers. Meanwhile, the support for the file format increased in the Linux world. In August, we saw the release of Krita 5.1, which had exactly that as one of its main features. Now we do gain read and write support too in Darktable\u0026rsquo;s latest version, 4.2. Darktable is an open source and cross platform RAW image editor. Other features of this release include: read-only support for WebP images, embedded ICC profiles in exported WebP files, support for JFIF files, and more.\n","date":"January 2, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2023/01/linux-rising-2023/","section":"2023s","summary":"","title":"Linux is RISING, KDE updates and more!","type":"2023"},{"content":"","date":"December 19, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2022/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"2022s","type":"2022"},{"content":"MAJOR investments, new hardware, huge updates, and more in this week of the TechHut Newsletter.

With that onto the news!\nOpenShot, Linux video editor, reaches major release 3.0 # OpenShot has just announced - after more than one year in the making - a new major release of the project. It brings a lot of new changes (in fact, it has over 1000 improvements and fixes, they say). The most significant improvements are support for 4k/HiDPI displays, support for Blender 3.3, stability and memory usage improvements, the ability to export multiple clips simultaneously, enhanced video playback performance, and timeline \u0026amp; usability improvements. There are also new export presets, such as GIF, but also MP3 audio-only, a Youtube 2K preset and a 4K one, MKV, and more. You can now also split the project into clips and then export all of those clips at the same time. Finally, something that’s often overlooked is the documentation. OpenShot’s User Guide was quite old and outdated. By this release, that has changed: there’s now a page to cover all OpenShot screens, all screenshots have been updated to be high-quality, and there are pages explaining how to use the editor. All of this is also now available as a PDF!\nDeepin releases version 20.8 with new \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; app # Whilst still working on the next major release of Deepin, 23, they’ve also announced a minor release for the current one. The most interesting change is the introduction of a “Home” app that’s supposed to help you interact with the Deepin community developers; a pretty interesting choice, since few other projects seem to have this kind of application. On the default screen, we get quick links to the Deepin forum, the Deepin bug tracker to report bugs, but also a section to suggest changes. These last two buttons, however, are labeled as “Coming”. You also get a link to a questionnaire, the project’s wiki, and github. Finally, you can join internal testing of the latest versions and read the community news. All of these things were available by using a web browser already, but having a dedicated app that links to them all in one place might help users out in joining the community. Other changes in this update include faster opening of Wine apps from the app store, and the native file manager getting the “format” option in the context menu.\nNew release of KDE Gear (= new KDE apps!) # The KDE Gear is the name under which almost all KDE apps go by; they have a synchronized release schedule so that there can be an announcement for all of them in one go. And we just got one! In the latest release, Dolphin gets a “selection mode”. You enter it by pressing spacebar and it allows you to easily select multiple files and act on them (copy, cut, etc); something that’s particularly useful if you have one-click-opens-file by default, or if you’re using a touchscreen computer. KDE Connect now supports inline message replies in notifications. That is, if you get a notification from a messaging app on your phone, you’ll see it on your desktop too, and you’ll be able to answer directly from the notification. Gwenview can also do some basic image editing by changing brightness, contrast, and gamma. Kate and KWrite get a new welcome screen that shows recent files and sessions, and you can switch the look to a hamburger menu instead of a menubar if you’re a fan of that. Kdenlive also now supports the hamburger menu as an opt-in and has improved its integration with other video applications. As an example, you can now export timeline clips to the Glaxanimate vector animation utility. Kalendar has introduced a new “basic” mode for views that help out with making the application performant even on low-end devices. The look of the even view has improved too and is now inside of a popup. And there’s even more! If you’re more of a KDE Plasma type of person, though, the next release will be in mid-February.\nFirefox releases version 108 # This is the last Firefox update of this year! The biggest feature is the support for the WebMIDI API. That is, Firefox (or, the webpages inside of it) will now be able to interact with MIDI devices connected to your computer. This is a nice new feature that Chrome previously implemented but that’s still lacking in Safari. Other changes in this update include better handling of non-ASCII characters when saving and printing PDFs, a new shift+esc shortcut to open the process manager, and support for seamless video looping on supported websites. Finally, Firefox previously blocked some graphic drivers for security reasons; with this release, there is a refactor of the WebRender driver which will have an “allow by default” policy. This should allow Firefox to run on more devices than before.\nValve is paying more than 100 Open Source developers to work on Proton, Mesa, and More # At the last KDE Akademy, we discovered that Valve is currently collaborating with KDE (via BlueSystems) to sponsor some work on the desktop and applications; and they had already hired a KWin developer to work on these technologies. One could wonder, at this point, what else is Valve sponsoring. According to an interview released to the Verge by Griffais, Valve is in fact sponsoring more than 100 open-source developers to work on a variety of components in their stack, such as the Mesa graphics driver and Vulkan. This really shows how much the company is giving back to the free software community as a whole.\nRead the entire interview here.\nPine announces new low-end Linux tablet # The original PineTab went wrong. It was originally conceived in 2018 and was available to order two years later; by coincidence, the year of the pandemic. This put the hardware production chain in great difficulty; eventually, the company preferred to shift its efforts into making the PinePhone available to order. By the time production could resume, it was clear that the internal components of the PineTab could be improved. Pine has thus preferred to work on redesigning the PineTab into the \u0026ldquo;PineTab 2\u0026rdquo;, which was just recently announced. Not only it uses a newer generation of SoC, but the chassis was also revamped and is now metal and sturdy (whilst still being easy to disassemble). There\u0026rsquo;s also a keyboard that acts as a cover too included out of the box; the base model will ship with 8GB RAM and 128GB flash, with no definitive date yet. If you just can\u0026rsquo;t wait, prototypes will be shown at FOSDEM (the annual free and open-source conference) early next year.\n","date":"December 19, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2022/12/valve-investments-deepin/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Valve making HUGE Investment in Open-Source, Deepin Home, and more!","type":"2022"},{"content":"Welcome to the 6th edition of the TechHut Newsletter. There is some huge news this week in tech and open source!\nAsahi Linux brings Hardware Acceleration to Linux on Apple Silicon # Asahi has announced their first release of Apple Silicon GPU drivers. This project has been under work for years and has finally reached an alpha status, where it’s good enough to power “a smooth desktop experience and some games”. More specifically, this brings OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0 support for all M-series.\nHowever, there’s still room for improvement (as an example, the drivers have not passed the OpenGL ES conformance tests yet, and will not support newer 3D games). Work for OpenGL 3 is also in progress; as an example, in the video above, it’s running SuperTuxKart!\nSystem76 shares updates about COSMIC DE # The hardware vendor System76 has begun the very complex journey to create a new desktop environment. It was hard, at the beginning, to fully understand how much of the software stack they wanted to re-write; with time, it has became clear that they wanted to use a new toolkit for Rust, called “iced” (already in use in many open-source projects).\nAfter this choice, it seems like they want to implement pretty much everything they need, starting from the compositor (”the part that’s responsible for making sure your application window reacts on-screen to the actions you perform within it”). The claim here is that there will be good support for fractional scaling and HiDPR, HDR; they also say that much time will be spent in making sure it works even when using NVIDIA. Keep in mind that core features of the Pop!_OS experience, like the tiling, have to be implemented in the compositor. They also have work going on to support font rendering correctly. This is much more complex than it appears: it has to work regardless of the language, font, typeface, and so on (and it has to be quick). There’s discussion going on with the iced developers in regards on how to best address this.\nGiven how much work has to be done, I’d be surprised if COSMIC was ready soon; but we will get frequent updates from now on and System76 is proving that they’re capable of handling such a big task.\nVivaldi Browser now has Mastodon Integration # A feature that Vivaldi is using to differentiate itself from other browsers is the side panel with various that could be useful whilst browsing. As an example, one of these sidebars allows for note-taking. Another sidebar element covers translation, and so on.\nIn the latest version of Vivaldi, there’s a new option to embed your Mastodon feed directly into the sidebar. This way, Vivaldi users can stay up to date even whilst performing another task on the main browser view (say that there’s a loading screen, as an example, or you’re watching a non-that-interesting video). Of course, you don’t have to use this if you’re not into this kind of feature, as it’s purely opt-in. It’s not the first time that the company expressed its appreciation of Mastodon; in fact, it had launched its own instance, “Vivaldi Social”.\nKDE Plasma now has Tiling Built-in # KDE Plasma now has tiling built-in; this is quite a big new feature that will be released in the next Plasma release, 5.27.\nFirstly and foremost, the new feature makes sure that when you tile two windows (e.g. by dragging them to the sides of the screen) and then resize one of them, the other one is also resized so that they won’t overlap. This is an immediate out-of-the-box improvement for everyone using Kwin.\nBut this also adds a dedicated view, which you can trigger with a shortcut, that allows you to divide the available screen space into “window areas”; done that, drag-and-dropping a window whilst holding the shift key will make it expand automatically in the window area it’s in. This is very similar to the concept, in Windows, of “Fancy Zones”.\nFinally, this will be useful for making Kwin scripting even more useful. There are currently many third-party scripts that implement some sort of tiling in KDE Plasma. Since the new tiling functionalities are exposed to the scripting API, these third parties will now be able to make use of it to make their automatic tiling even better.\nlink to story\nTwitter turns its back on Open Source development # Twitter heavily relies on open-source software, and that shouldn’t come as a surprise. As an example, the entire network runs on CentOS 7. Before Musk bought the company, there were active plans to help out the OS projects that Twitter relied on, with people hired to work on Bazel, Scala, Hadoop, etc. Given that CentOS 7 has its end of life on June 2024, there even was a plan to switch to CentOS Stream. The momentum was clearly in favor of making use of Open Source and giving back to the community at the same time.\nOf course, this is one of the things that changed with Musk. Now, no one is left to transition to CentOS Stream, and most people working on Open Source projects are gone. That’s quite a U-turn. In the short term, this might not have any effect on Twitter: they can still use these projects as they were doing before. But this significantly changes the image of the company between the developers that maintain them (if they’re maintained at all), breaking the bond of trust that’s essential in the free software world.\nNew Third-Party GNOME Project for Video Meetings # Among other changes and improvements in the GNOME world, there’s the announcement of a new third-party application that’s a client for BigBlueButton, the open-source video meetings software. This is the platform that KDE internally uses too! Its functionalities go beyond just being able to chat together, but it is a full virtual “classroom” too: you can set a slideshow (no need to share the screen) and you can freely write on the slides collaboratively. You also have a public chat and shared meeting notes.\nNot all of this is available on “Meeting Point” (the name of the GNOME client) yet, but you already have the basic stuff: chat, video, etc.; with time, the remaining functionalities will likely be implemented too. So, if you need to have video meetings, or if you’re a teacher in a virtual classroom, this project might be really interesting!\n","date":"December 11, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2022/12/asahi-gpu-drivers-cosmic-updates-kde-tiling/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Asahi GPU Drivers, COSMIC Updates, KDE Tiling and more!","type":"2022"},{"content":"","date":"December 5, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/apache/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Apache","type":"tags"},{"content":"Creating a basic Apache web server is often the first step in your web development journey. Apache is the base requirement for many web applications and products. Better yet, you can use an Apache web server to host your self-made or generated static websites with something like HUGO.\nIn this video, we will be using Linode to host the server. You can use any VPS provider or even do this on your own hardware. Linode sponsors the companion video attached to this article, and if you use our link, you can get a $100 60-day credit. Below is the full video with all the steps and commands needed.\nhttps://youtu.be/VXSgEvZKp-8\nVPN and Domain # First, set up your VPN. With Linode, all you need to do is create a new Linode and select your distro; for this, I use Ubuntu 22.04 and pick your region and plan. For the plan, you can start with the $5/month plan, and you can upgrade as needed. Pick a strong root password and if you\u0026rsquo;d like setup your SSH key for added security.\nFor my demo, I used Linode\u0026rsquo;s domain manager. You can set up your domain using A records with your IP address. All I did was point the root \u0026lsquo;@\u0026rsquo; to the Linode IP. For more information on domains, check the links below.\nhttps://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/dns-manager\nInitial Setup # After creating our Linode, you can log in via SSH on your local terminal application of choice. You will have the command on your dashboard. Once you sign in, the very first thing you should do is update your server.\napt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt upgrade -y Next, lets change our host files to match with the domain we will be hosting.\nnano /etc/hostname Change the value \u0026rsquo;localhost\u0026rsquo; to \u0026rsquo;example.com\u0026rsquo;, replacing the example with your domain.\nnano /etc/hosts Add a new line under the local host line and match it with the image below.\nNow, lets create a limited sudo user. You can make the username anything you\u0026rsquo;d like just replace \u0026lsquo;brandon\u0026rsquo; with your username of preference. When you input the first command it will ask you for your name and other information. You can press enter to skip or fill out the information. Then we will add the user to the sudo group and switch to that user.\nadduser brandon adduser brandon sudo su brandon The steps below to disable root login are optional but are recommended steps for security.\nOpen the file sshd_config located in the /etc/ssh directory using Nano or your favorite text editor.\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Change the value of the key PermitRootLogin from yes to no\nSave and close the file.\nNext, you will restart the sshd daemon to read the configuration after your modifications.\nUse the following command to restart the daemon:\nsudo systemctl restart sshd Now, it is recommended we reboot our server as some updates will need you to, and this will update the host files.\nInstall and Configure Apache # Now, we get to install Apache and set up our very first website. Log back into your server via SSH, this time using the username instead of root. Then type the command below to install the needed packages, and check to see if it is running.\nsudo apt install apache2 apache2-docs apache2-utils systemctl status apache2 At this point you can see if it is working on a web browser and check to see if the domain has fully proergated over if you changed any nameservers. Simply copy/paste your IP into the web browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar and you should see the Apache2 Default Page. Use the commands below to disable the default website, as we will be creating our own directories and configurations later.\nsudo a2dissite 000-default.conf sudo systemctl reload apache2 Firewall Configuration # Now, we need to enable and allow some applications with our firewall.

GTK already supports that platform, but the current look is the same that you’d find on GNOME, which won’t feel native at all to Mac users. With these patches applied, a variety of features are supported: MacOS native controls are supported (e.g. minimize, maximize, and close buttons), vibrancy’s supported (which allows for pretty translucent sidebars), the accent color is supported (meaning that it will be following the systemwide colorscheme), and the titlebar merges with the content nicely as shown in the image. Of course, dark mode is supported as well.\nKDE’s hiring a developer and has launched a Blue Friday fundraising # KDE’s now hiring a software engineer to work on its stack: Plasma, Frameworks, and so on. This is actually a first for the organization, as all previous hires were either about non-technical positions (e.g. promotion) or not directly about improving KDE’s products code-wise (e.g. documentation or packaging). All current KDE developers are either hired by third party companies to work on KDE’s products or are volounteers; this will finally change with the new hire.\nAt the same time, there has been the launch of the end-of-the-year fundraising campaign, aligning to Black Friday; it’s called Blue Friday, and it makes it much easier to donate to the organization. This also supports recurring donations, which were only previously allowed via the KDE “relate” project, which was rather hard to use.\nhttps://pointieststick.com/2022/11/23/a-better-fundraising-platform\nTool to create theme-adaptive wallpapers has been redesigned # Both GNOME and KDE Plasma support adaptive wallpapers (that change depending on whether you have a light or dark theme). Upon the introduction of this feature, though, the creation of adaptive wallpapers required some manual effort. This has been solved by the application “Dynamic Wallpaper”, which has just been redesigned. The new UI is very simple to use and fits nicely with the GNOME design guidelines. Although the application has been designed with GNOME in mind it should cover the usecases of Plasma users as well, since GNOME and Plasma use the same format to store the adaptive wallpapers.\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/11/dynamic-wallpaper-maker-for-gnome-desktop-updated-with-new-ui\nThe new StarFighter by StarLabs laptop can now be bought # StarLabs has been teasing this new laptop for months, and new it’s on sale. This might easily be one of the most interesting (and expensive) Linux laptops on the market; it has super thin bezels but preserves camera quality (FHD 1080p, 60fps) by having it as a detachable component that can be stored inside the laptop itself. This is also great as far as privacy goes: having the webcam connected to the laptop only when you actually need to use it will add a layer of safety.\nNot the only one, though: the laptop also comes with kill switch for Wi-Fi too. It is also remarkable that - compared to other thin-and-lights like the Dell XPS - the StarFighter preserves an amazing I/O: HDMI, 2xUSB-C, 2xUSB-A, microSD, Combo Jack. The screen is matte (anti-glare), up to 4k, with a 16:10 aspect ratio, a refresh rate of 165Hz, and super bright (600cd/m²). Similarly to the latest MacBooks, the touchpad doesn’t have physical buttons but has haptic feedback, which will make - in theory - the entire touchpad area very easy to click on. The quality of the touchpad glass is also supposed to be really good: it’s name Cassidy Glass, after Cassidy James (GNOME/Elementary dev) who very positively reviewed it on a different device.\nhttps://9to5linux.com/you-can-now-buy-the-starfighter-4k-linux-laptop-from-star-labs\nNew update from Maui with new application # Maui is a project that aims to re-use KDE Frameworks to provide their own Toolkit, applications, and even desktop environment. They’ve just announced a new version, 2.2.1, which brings significant improvements to many of their existing applications: they improved the (already really good) design by allowing for more translucent components, merged the toolbars inside tabbars, and cleaned up menus. The “About” dialog also got better, by showing more information about translators and libraries used. Most importantly, they added yet another application to their (already impressive, considering how young they are) app ecosystem: Arca, to open archives files.\nHowever, this update is much bigger than just what I summarized here; there’s also work going on in the toolkit itself and on the desktop. Maui is still a young project that might not be ready for daily use, but it’s surely moving at an impressive speed.\nhttps://mauikit.org/blog/maui-2-2-1-release\n","date":"December 3, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2022/12/gtk-patches-starlabs-kde/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"GTK patches, new StarLabs laptop, big Maui updates and MORE!","type":"2022"},{"content":" Thunderbird teases “Supernova” Massive Update # In its latest announcement, the Thunderbird team has teased a “Supernova” update for 2023. This will come with a complete redesign, but big features too. The most interesting one is Firefox Sync, which will allow you to cloud sync email accounts, calendars, the address book, your RSS feed, and so on. This will become particularly useful with the upcoming release of Thunderbird for Android - also coming in 2023 - based on K9 mail.\nAfter the “Supernova” redesign, you’ll have the option to collapse the weekend in the calendar view to save up some space (of course, with the ability to set what days to consider weekends, to accommodate all kinds of work schedules). Calendar actions will move to a context menu, keeping the toolbar visually clean; but you can still fully customize it if that’s not for you.You can search through Thunderbird, now with hotkey hints to help you out; to make it easier to find a particular event, that search has a dedicated sidebar. As a whole, the design has been revamped and looks much more modern.\nVerified Apps are coming to Flathub, Kodi’s first # Last month, code was merged into Flathub to show a verified badge on an application’s page if you could prove you own an application, its repository, and the domain of the app ID (e.g., “org.mozilla.firefox”). This badge has now appeared in Kodi, an app to play and view videos, music, podcasts, etc.; you can see how it looks in the image. There’s still some discussion ongoing from the technical point of view; as an example, there’s not a consensus yet on whether GNOME extensions should get verified or not. This is another step towards making Flathub a safe place to install applications; most importantly, you don’t have to pay 8$ to get the badge.\nhttps://debugpointnews.com/flathub-verification-kodi\nMastodon 4: The Toot Is Gone. # In these days of great migration from Twitter to Mastodon, we get the fourth version of the software, which includes lots of new changes. One of the first you might notice is that the button to publish posts in no longer called “Toot”; now it’s, simply, “Publish”. The story behind the old name is actually pretty funny, as the original label was “Publish”, actually. However, a famous Youtuber decided to sponsor the project if - and only if, jokingly - the button change its label to “Toot”.\nSince Mastodon’s author did not know that the word is a synonym for “fart” in American English, he went for it. A decision that has now been reverted with the goal of making the software as simple as possible for newcomers.On a more serious note, new features of Mastodon 4 are following hashtags, translating posts, editing, an improved filtering system, customizable user roles for administration, and more.\nhttps://gizmodo.com/mastodon-toot-retired-twitter-tweet-equivalent-184978622\nKDE publishes 100th version of their Frameworks 5 # Since the release of Frameworks 5.0, KDE has published one version each month, and has now reached the 100th version. KDE not only delivers a desktop, but has also various applications and - in this case - a big library of ~80 frameworks that are used in other KDE products, and in various third party projects too. For this reasons, the latest update brings improvements across the board: it’s easier to show hidden files in Dolphin, the Plasma System Monitor is now stable when using NVIDIA, apps no longer hang when files in their “Recent Documents” are no longer accessible (e.g.: you deleted them). The button to delete file now says “Delete Permanently” (to avoid any misunderstanding) and, if you center widgets in your panel, the popup that appears when you click on them will be centered too.\nhttps://9to5linux.com/kde-frameworks-5-100-released-with-many-improvements-for-plasma-desktop-and-apps\n","date":"November 16, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2022/11/thunderbird-supernova-toots-gone-kde-update/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Thunderbird “Supernova” Update, Toots be gone, and more!","type":"2022"},{"content":"","date":"November 2, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/red-hat/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Red Hat","type":"tags"},{"content":"Near the end of 2020, Red Hat decided to kill CentOS as we know it—kind of. We’ll get that a bit later. But for now, let\u0026rsquo;s examine Red Hat Enterprise Linux and all of the clones and forks that we have available. So, let’s get to it.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux # Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL for short, is a Linux distribution developed by, believe it or not, Red Hat. RHEL is an RPM-based distribution that uses the DNF package manager and follows a more LTS-like release cycle with an older package base. RHEL’s package base actually comes from earlier versions of Fedora, making Fedora a testing ground for different changes that may come to Red Hat. For example, the latest version of RHEL 9.0 is based on Fedora 34 from March 2021. Do note, though, that while Fedora is sponsored by Red Hat and uses some Red Hat infrastructure, Fedora is still its own project that may make decisions against Red Hat. Another thing that makes Red Hat special is that a lot of modern technology in the Linux world is either significantly funded by Red Hat or run or heavily contributed to by Red Hat developers, A bunch of examples of this include GNOME Shell, SELinux, SystemD, PackageKit, Wayland, D-Bus, and many other projects. However, another thing that made Red Hat different is that it’s a paid Linux distro, but paying for it gives you support and docs from the Red Hat company.\nCentOS # This is where CentOS came in. Because Red Hat was a paid distro, and people may be fine with community support/docs instead of official Red Hat docs, a rebuild of RHEL was formed called CentOS. CentOS essentially took Red Hat’s source code, removed Red Hat branding, added its repositories, and then compiled it themselves. So, if you needed Red Hat and didn’t care about the support from the company, you would install CentOS. Red Hat later bought the project out, and things continued running smoothly. However, as mentioned earlier, Red Hat stopped supporting CentOS halfway through CentOS 8’s release cycle, and many people consider that to be the death of CentOS. This resulted in many new RHEL rebuilds and clones, including Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, and more that we will get into later.\nCentOS Stream # However, CentOS’s death was overblown because CentOS Stream replaced it, and what stream was severely miscommunicated to the community. CentOS Stream was essentially just Red Hat but with one huge difference. Instead of small fixes and changes needing to make their way into RHEL, they are rebuilt into CentOS. They would be implemented into CentOS Stream first and then RHEL second. This made contributing to both CentOS and RHEL much easier because you wouldn’t have to deal with the bureaucracy that comes from trying to contribute to a paid Linux distro. The issue with the communication was that they pushed Stream as a completely different thing. Not many people know how Stream actually works, and Stream is just horrible branding because it makes it sound like a bleeding-edge rolling release distro. They also killed CentOS 8 halfway through its normal life cycle and made people “migrate” to a new branch of CentOS. It\u0026rsquo;s not a good look for something that was supposed to be an LTS distro. I think it would have been better if they just made this change in CentOS 9 without a whole rebranding or kept CentOS Stream separate.\nAlternatives # However, the damage from the bad rebranding of CentOS Stream has already been done, and there are now loads of options if you want a good Red Hat Enterprise-like Linux experience. So, let’s look at each of them and find out which one may be the best for you.\nRed Hat backed # RHEL Free # Let’s talk about the 2 official projects backed by Red Hat, both of which we already mentioned. CentOS Stream and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Believe it or not, Red Hat offers a free program for individual users. This does have a few limitations. For example, you can only register 16 systems running RHEL, but it also gives you access to all of RHEL’s releases and their documentation and resources for learning how to use RHEL. If you are trying to learn how to use an Enterprise Linux system like this, I would recommend learning with the RHEL Free plan because it gives you access to the same documentation and self-support resources you can get from paying for Red Hat. However, if you want to use RHEL for a personal use case, I recommend another system because RHEL Free is kind of a hassle to set up. Mainly because you still need to make an account to download it, and once installed, you need to register it with an entitlement server.\nCentOS Stream # On the other hand, CentOS Stream is still a great option if you need an RHEL-like server, although it isn’t an exact clone like many of these other distros are. While CentOS Stream, for the most part, will function almost the same as RHEL, since it is used as a development ground for RHEL, it won’t be 100% bug for bug compatible with RHEL. And I’ll get to what bug for bug compatible means later. The point is if you want something like a web server or would like to self-host something, and you would prefer to do it with a distro in the RHEL family compared to something like Debian or Ubuntu, then I think CentOS Stream is one of the best, options to look at. You still get rock-solid stability, it’s close enough to mainline Red Hat that you won’t need to relearn much if anything at all, and you will get bug fixes and other minor updates slightly faster than regular RHEL.\nCommunity-Backed RHEL Rebuilds # Next, let’s talk about some of the community-backed rebuilds of RHEL. Some of these may have some small bonus features, but for the most part, they are RHEL with different repos, a rebrand, and community support instead of corporate support. All of these should also be bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL, which means that the vast majority of packages should be identical to an installation of Red Hat. If a bug exists in RHEL, it should also exist in these rebuilds.\nRocky Linux # Let’s start with Rocky Linux. This distro emerged after CentOS’s death and aimed to fill the void that CentOS left. It was started by one of the co-founders of CentOS, Gregory Kurtzer. Rocky Linux was named to honor another CentOS co-founder who died, Rocky McGough. The company that runs it is called the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation, and they are structured as a Public Benefit Corporation. But because it technically is a corporation, it does move slower than other distros like Alma, which came with its rebuild of RHEL 9 more than a month before Rocky Linux.\nAlma Linux # Speaking of Alma Linux, that’s the other CentOS replacement that came out of the death of CentOS. This was started and heavily funded by CloudLinux, but it became a community project that also received funding from many major companies such as AWS, ARM, and Microsoft. Unlike Rocky Linux, and despite it being started by CloudLinux, Alma is run by a 501 non-profit. It also seems to get releases faster than Rocky Linux, with only 9 days between RHEL’s 9.0 release and Alma’s 9.0 release. Because it has more backing, faster release schedules, and other factors, it has become the most popular community-based RHEL clone.\nCorporate-Backed RHEL Rebuilds # Now, let’s look at some other options that are corporate-backed and not community-run projects. Most of these have gotten an earlier start and existed for years before the death of CentOS.\nOracle Linux # Let’s start with the biggest corporate-backed alternative, Oracle Linux. This is another rebuild of Red Hat with replaced branding for the most part. However, remember that it is not 100% binary compatible, and some packages have some differences. For example, Oracle ships its quote “Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel” with newer kernel versions and some performance enhancements, although a RHEL-compatible kernel is offered. There are also some differences in other core components, such as glibc and openssl, among other things.\nEuroLinux # Another corporate-backed distro is EuroLinux. This is a RHEL rebuild backed by the company EuroLinux. It is a 1:1 bug for bug compatible with RHEL and EuroLinux. The company does provide support for EuroLinux, the distro. They also have migration scripts to migrate RHEL, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Rocky, and Alma to EuroLinux. They do have a free version that you can use as a RHEL rebuild. Still, they also have a paid version that provides you access to RHEL 6 and 7-based versions of Euro Linux, full support, and access to additional intermediate packages and documentation.\nVzLinux # Finally, VzLinux, which is a RHEL rebuild owned by Virtuozzo, was made to be a base for their own operating systems, such as OpenVz. It is a 1:1 bug for bug compatible with Red Hat, but other than that, there’s not much going on that can differentiate it from Alma and Rocky. It has multiple flavors, with the standard bare metal version and a special version for containers and virtual environments. It also has a feature called Chameleon, which edits the os-release file to look like either RHEL or CentOS. This is good if you are trying to run software like CPanel that will only install on distros that it supports, like Alma. However, I feel that Virtuozzo only maintains this distro because they use it themselves. Outside of its own product line, there’s very little amount of documentation for it, updates are slow, and the website for it feels more like a landing page than a website for distribution.\nHonorable Mentions # Those are the main distributions that can be used as drop-in replacements for CentOS, so let’s talk about some other distributions that will give you a similar experience, but I may not recommend them for various reasons.\nNavy and Circle Linux # Let’s start with Navy Linux and Circle Linux. Navy Linux is another Red Hat rebuild run by a Delaware non-profit. I don’t recommend Navy Linux because of any issues with the distro itself but because it is too small of a project, in my opinion. It only has a few corporate sponsors, its GitHub only has 5 repositories, only 2 of which have been updated in the last 30 days as of October 9th, 2022, and of those 2 repos, one of them is the website, the other is just docker images. As of the time of this video, Navy Linux still hasn’t had a rebuild of RHEL 9 yet, and its website has a noticeable lack of information. CircleLinux is a bit better, this is a Chinese-based community ran project and it’s actually backed by Huawei and Tencent. However, it took them quite a while to come out with their rebuild of RHEL 9, and there’s really not much about it that makes you wanna use it over Alma or Rocky. Both of these are binary compatible with RHEL. Still, in general, since they’re much smaller than these other distros, you won’t be seeing as many guides and community support available for these distros, and honestly, I don’t see these 2 distros lasting that long.\nFedora # The last honorable mention is Fedora. Fedora is an honorable mention simply because it can not replace Red Hat, but for many use cases, it’s a good option, and the system structure is very similar to RHEL. Fedora was upstream for CentOS Stream before CentOS Stream became Red Hat, so brand new Fedora releases contain a lot of tech and features that may become part of a future release of Red Hat. It’s also worth noting that because of this relationship, a lot of the structure of a Fedora system is similar to current or future Red Hat releases. Because of this, some people even consider it a part of the RHEL family. But, very important to remember that it is not even close to being binary compatible with Red Hat because it uses newer packages. However, this is the way to go if you want to run a server with newer packages but still want it to feel like Red Hat and CentOS. I’ve always recommended this as a desktop distro, but even for server use cases where you need newer packages, it’s a very solid distro to go to.\n","date":"November 2, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rocky-linux-almalinux-rhel-centos-which-is-best-for-you/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, RHEL, CentOS - Which Is BEST for You?","type":"2022"},{"content":"Lots of interesting things over the last two weeks.

Finally, Pipewire is now the default audio engine in Ubuntu which is great.\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/08/ubuntu-22-10-release-new-features\nNVIDIA hates Windows too? # One common Linux issue is how much of a pain NVIDIA graphics cards can be on Linux. They are fine on distros like Ubuntu and Pop OS that automatically install proprietary NVIDIA drivers on first run if you have an NVIDIA GPU, however if you are on a distribution like Fedora, Debian, or OpenSUSE\u0026hellip; good luck. Even when you do get them installed, NVIDIA drivers on Linux are still very finicky and basic things like Wayland support and dual GPU support can be very buggy. Well, I am pleased to report we are not the only ones suffering. The latest Windows 11 22H2 update has been having issues with NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s driver including frame drops, screen tearing, and other performance issues. NVIDIA did issue an emergency software update to fix it, but not all issue were fixed, with hardware reviewer Nadalina reporting that there were still micro-suttering in games and lower 1% frame rate figures in a couple of games.\nhttps://www.neowin.net/news/windows-11-22h2-and-nvidia-drivers-apparently-still-refusing-to-play-nicely-together\nXbox Mobile Storefront # Speaking of Microsoft, for those who haven\u0026rsquo;t heard, Microsoft is trying to buy Activision Blizzard. This has been a very controversial acquisition because of Activision Blizzard owning massive console selling games such as Overwatch 2, Call of Duty, and Diablo. Because of how massive this is, the UK government is investigating Microsoft for this deal, and during this investigation, we were able to discover that part of the goal of this acquisition was allow Microsoft to expand into the app store business. Yes, we may be seeing Microsoft trying to compete with the Play Store on Android. This may also explain why Microsoft was trying to defend Epic Games on it\u0026rsquo;s lawsuit against Apple\u0026rsquo;s App Store monopoly.\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-plans-xbox-mobile-storefront-to-rival-apple-and-google\nPolyMC Collapses # The popular Minecraft launcher PolyMC has collapsed after the owner \u0026ldquo;LennyMcLennington\u0026rdquo; decided to kick developers of the project who were \u0026ldquo;promoting radicalist leftist queer ideology\u0026rdquo;. Initially people thought that the owner had been compromised but LennyMcLennington has denied the claims with a signed PGP signature as proof. While most people are switching away from PolyMC, either as a precautionary measure, or for ideological reasons, some players are sticking with PolyMC. That said, PolyMC does still plan to continue development with the owner working to recruit new developers and debunk the rumors of PolyMC being a malware risk. That said, all of the kicked developers got together on a new fork of PolyMC dubbed \u0026ldquo;Prism Launcher\u0026rdquo;. This fork only took 2 days to come out with a new release and packages for many distros and packaging formats including The AUR, Alpine Linux, NixOS, makedeb, Copr, as well as AppImage and Flathub.\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/hijacking-of-popular-minecraft-launcher-by-rogue-developer-raises-malware-fears\nPocket Casts goes Open Source # The popular podcast platform \u0026ldquo;Pocket Casts\u0026rdquo; recently released it\u0026rsquo;s mobile apps on GitHub under the Mozilla Public License. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a surprise after Automattic\u0026rsquo;s recent acquisition of Pocket Casts because Automattic is very friendly to open source, and owns many open source projects such as Wordpress, Jetpack, Simplenote, and WooCommerce. Wordpress is one of the biggest open source projects in the world, and Automattic CEO and Founder Matt Mullenweg is also a big fan of open source. However, that said, Pocket Casts hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet open sourced their server side yet, and the desktop and web apps for it are still proprietary and under a paywall. But it is interesting to see such a popular app randomly get open sourced.\nFeatured GitHub Repo: miniPaint # miniPaint is an online image editor that let\u0026rsquo;s you create and edit images through HTML5.

Depending on the Pi you have, you may be able to emulate old arcade games all the way up to Play Station 1 and N64 games. RetroPie itself allows us to emulate a good number of older consoles. Before we get into the setup, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about what you\u0026rsquo;ll actually need to accomplish this.\nGear # Raspberry Pi # RetroPie works with Raspberry Pi A, A+, B, B+, Zero, 2, 3, and 4. The Raspberry Pi 4 is recommended for PS1 and N64 emulation. Pi 3 can play them, but it may need to be overclocked.\nPower Supply # Make sure this works with your Pi model. If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure, check out this article to ensure your Pi is getting enough power.\nSD Card # RetroPi requires at least an 8 GB SD card. Personally, I know that I will have a huge library of games, so I will be using a 32 GB SD. Generally, ROMS are very small, with many of them being a few megabytes and some PS1 games being around 600mb.\nController # You will need this actually to play your games. I use an old wired Xbox 360 controller. You can use almost any USB controller. There are many close-to-original USB controllers on Amazon, such as clones of the NES, SNES, N64, PS1, Genesis, Atari, and more.\nCase and Fan # Now a case and fan isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary, but its much better using one of these than not. Without a case, your Raspberry Pi will be completely exposed and is more likely to get dusty and/or damaged. Additionally, many cases come with cooling solutions. Using a fan is definitively recommended as you will get better performance overall. I have a video covering some of the performance differences between not using anything, adding a heatsink, and cooling with a fan.\nIn the video version of this article, I feature the GeeekPi Raspberry Pi Mini Tower Kit. I like this because it is larger, allowing for the inclusion of a CPU fan, so there is really good airflow, and it just looks awesome overall. Plus, there is a little adapter, so you still have access to the GPIO.\nRetroPie Setup # Flashing SD # There are two different ways to flash RetroPie on your SD card. You can download and flash manually using a tool like Etcher or Gnome Disks or use the Raspberry Pi Imager. I recommend trying out the Imager, as it will handle the download and flashing for you.\nTo get the Imager, you go to their website and follow their instructions on downloading and installing, depending on your operating system. When you have the application open you\u0026rsquo;ll want to click \u0026lsquo;Choose OS\u0026rsquo; then select \u0026lsquo;Emulation and game OS\u0026rsquo;, pick \u0026lsquo;RetroPie\u0026rsquo; and select the right download for your system. Insert the SD card into your computer, click \u0026lsquo;Choose Storage, \u0026rsquo; and select the SD card. Ensure there is nothing important here, as it will get erased. Now click \u0026lsquo;Write\u0026rsquo; and wait for the application to finish.\nFirst Boot # Once the SD card is flashed and you boot into your system, there are some initial steps. One thing to mention is that on first boot, it will resize the file system automatically to ensure you can use all the space on your SD for storing your ROMS. There is also an option to do this later if this doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen for you.\nConfigure Gamepad # When it finishes the resizing process, your Raspberry Pi will reboot. Next, you will be greeted with the gamepad configuration process. This is done to map out the buttons on the controller properly to be used by RetroPie. Make sure you pay attention and press the correct buttons, as mic inputs can cause issues in the future, but do note you can reconfigure the gamepad through the settings if needed. Also, RetroPie is fairly smart and can remember mapping for multiple different controllers.\nSelect WLAN Country # From there, we can proceed to setting our country so that we can connect to our Wi-Fi network. If you\u0026rsquo;re using the ethernet port, you can skip the Wi-Fi steps.\nFirst, select the large Configuration option from the home screen and then open the Raspi-Config option. This will take you to a terminal user interface with all the possible options within RetroPie. In this menu, select option 5, which is the Localization Options. Please note that selecting these menu options may differ from the standard RetroPie main menu. Ie. A (east) is used to select is the main menu, while B (south) is used to select in the Raspi-Config menus.\nIn this menu, select L4 WLAN County, and you will get a huge list of possible options. Select your country. Also note that in some of the menus, there will be a Select and Back option. You will use the up and down arrow keys to highlight the option you want, and then press the right arrow key to highlight Select or Back to continue from there.\nDisable Underscan # Underscan adds black bars around the display. This is a great option to keep enabled if you\u0026rsquo;re using an older CRT TV to keep the retro feel. But if you\u0026rsquo;re using a modern flatscreen panel, disabling it is a good option. To do this, go to the first page in the Raspi-Config menu and select option 2, Display Options. From here, select D2 Underscan, and when the Yes/No dialog (displayed below) comes up, select No.\nReboot RetroPie # To ensure all these settings are in place for our Wifi connection, we will want to reboot our system. We can do this by selecting Finish from the main Raspi-Config menu. This will ask you if you\u0026rsquo;d like to reboot. Say yes.\nConnecting to WiFi # Once it reboots, you will be taken to RetroPie\u0026rsquo;s main homepage. Once again, jump into the RetroPie configuration. In this menu, there will be an option to connect to Wi-Fi.\nIn the Wifi selection menu, this will look very similar to the Raspi-Config menus. Select the first option, and it will scan for Wifi networks. Select your and input your password. Once connected, you will be able to see your IP address. Write this down as you will need it to load your ROMS.\nEnable SSH # SSH enables us to connect to our Raspberry Pi via a terminal and other file transfer interfaces. To do this, open Raspi-Config and select option 3 Interface Options. The second option from here is SSH; select it. From there, go ahead and enable. Do note the warning of security risk. It is recommended that you change your password, but we will address this later.\nAdding ROMS # FTP is a way to move files from one computer/server to another. This is what we will use to move ROMS onto our Raspberry Pi. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be using FileZilla, my favorite FTP application. Open FileZilla; on the top, there will be a place to input your login information. For the host, use \u0026lsquo;sftp://yourIP\u0026rsquo;, and the default username and password is \u0026lsquo;pi\u0026rsquo; followed by \u0026lsquo;raspberry\u0026rsquo;. If everything was done correctly, the RaspberryPi filesystem will populate after you click connect.\nUnder RetroPi/roms, there will be a bunch of folders with the consoles that are supported by default. For example, snes is where you\u0026rsquo;d place your Super Nintendo ROMS. You can navigate your local system on the left panel, find your ROMs, and drag and drop them into the correct folders. When you reboot your system, the games will display, and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to play!\nNOTE: This guide is a work in progress.

The initial reaction was met with correction as this will only affect Video Acceleration API support for H.264, H.265, and VC-1 codecs. This is due to legal worry as there could be push back from patent holders. This will primarily affect AMD GPU users and any user who uses open-source graphics drivers, preventing them from using GPU acceleration to play video content that requires these codecs.\nhttps://news.itsfoss.com/fedora-drops-vaapi-codec\nNextcloud Hub 3 is HERE! # This is one of the largest releases in the history of Nextcloud.

Better yet, we got a preview of what this could look like visually.\nPop!_OS COSMIC desktop is going to use Iced Rust Toolkit rather than GTK that is used in GNOME. A developer on Reddit stated the following.\nYou are quick at noticing. Jeremy just started working on this yesterday. This is a design demo application that will showcase all of the widgets and theming capabilities available in the COSMIC design system. This will also be the COSMIC library that we\u0026rsquo;ll be using to develop COSMIC applications from. The UX team has been carefully designing widgets and applications over the last year. We are now at the point where it is critical for the engineering team to decide upon a GUI toolkit for COSMIC. After much deliberation and experimentation over the last year, the engineering team has decided to use Iced instead of GTK. Iced is a native Rust GUI toolkit that\u0026rsquo;s made enough progress lately to become viable for use in COSMIC. Various COSMIC applets have already been written in both GTK and Iced for comparison. The latest development versions of Iced have an API that\u0026rsquo;s very flexible, expressive, and intuitive compared to GTK. It feels very natural in Rust, and anyone familiar with Elm will appreciate its design. COSMIC Settings will be developed in tandem with, and from, this toolkit.\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/09/excited-for-pop_os-22-10-dont-be\nTwitter Blue is starting to roll out an edit button # If you follow TechHut on Twitter you probably have seen quite a few examples of how an edit button on the platform would be beneficial to everyone.

Then I read a little further and realized that this is the most powerful SBC I have ever had the opportunity to examine. In this article, we will examine the specs and see how the device actually performs.\nHardware # This board is surprisingly powerful. It features a Rockchip RK3588S. This is an 8-core ARM CPU (up to 2.25GHz clock speed). x4 2.25GHz Cortex-A76 performance cores are paired with x4 1.8GHz Cortex-A55 efficiency cores. Also, depending on your configuration, it will have 32/64 GB of EMMC storage and 8/16GB of LPDDR4X RAM.\nGraphics rendering and performance will also benefit from the integrated ARM Mali-G610 MP4 quad-core GPU clocked up to 1GHz. On its website, it says it supports up to 8k encoding up to 30fps and decoding up to 60fps.\nThe board also has a good number of options for the device\u0026rsquo;s connectivity. Below is an image from their website of the I/O, but the most important things to note are that there are x2 USB-C, x1 USB 2, x1 USB 3, HDMI, and plugins for the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 6 antennas found in the box. One important note is that no Ethernet option is shipped with the device, but you can add your own later.\nThese are shipping with a CPU fan to help keep it cool, as it will get quite hot. Do note that the wires on the fan are weak, so be careful when plugging them in. I broke mine by mistake and will need to repair them.\nSoftware # This board does not ship with an operating system pre-installed, but rather a user interface for downloading and installing various ARM operating systems from the cloud. The interface is called OOWOW. OOWOW is an embedded service (integrated into your device)—it can be run at any time if you need to perform essential maintenance services on your device.\nNo matter what you install on the EMMC storage, you can access this embedded system by holding the function button and pressing restart. You will be greeted with a menu that looks similar to a legacy bios. This will allow you to connect to Wi-Fi, install and reinstall your operating system, download images, backup and restore, configure your device, access a rescue shell, and more.\nAt the time of writing and recording, there are only a few operating system choices: Ubuntu 22.04, both the GNOME and Server views, and Android. I wish there were more to pick from, for example, Fedora, Arch, and other popular ARM systems. Just because there is not an easy option in this menu to install other systems does not mean this isn\u0026rsquo;t possible. Here is a guide on their forums for installing Fedora Linux on their hardware.\nReview # This computer is the most powerful ARM SBC I have ever used.

It has sparked the interest of the dedicated Linux community and new users alike. Dual-booting has helped with this! One major hesitation of the new Linux user is wiping Windows from their life completely. Luckily, this is not a necessity. In this guide, we will go over step-by-step instructions on how to install Pop!_OS alongside Windows and update the bootloader.\nWARNING: This is an old method that uses legacy bios. I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend checkout the updated article here: https://youtu.be/VaIgbTOvAd0.\nGetting Ready # First, we will need to gather some resources. These instructions assume you’re doing this from a Windows machine. We will start by downloading Pop!_OS and installing a USB flashing tool.\n1. Download Pop!_OS # Pop!_OS by System76 # Imagine an OS for the software developer, maker, and computer science professional who uses their computer as a tool to discover and create. Welcome to Pop!_OS.\nWhen you download Pop!_OS make sure you download the right version. You can check your system to see if you need the version pre-loaded with the proper NIVIDA drivers. You can check by going into Device Manager and looking under ‘Display adapters’.\n2. Download and Install Etcher # Download and Install the balenaEtcher tool. We will use this to flash the Pop!_OS ISO image to the USB to ensure that it is bootable.\nOnce Etcher is installed, select the ISO file from the directory that you downloaded it. Insert a blank USB with at least 4gb of free space. Click on ‘Select target’ and pick the USB drive you’d like to use to install Pop!_OS.\nOnce everything is selected click on ‘Flash!’ and it will begin to burn the image onto the USB. Once it is done it will validate and give the finished prompt.\n3. Free Up Some Space # This can be done though the live disk image, but doing this on the Windows side will prevent some issues from arising later.\nImportant: Ensure everything in your system that is important is completely backed by before performing any system changes.\nOpen the ‘Disk management’ tool\nRight click on your main boot partition that holds your Windows 10 operating system. Click on ‘Shrink Volume’\nHere is where you will select the amount of free space to make available for the new Pop!_OS installation. Make sure you leave enough space for Windows depending on the work you need to do within the operating system.\nClick on ‘Shrink’ and you’ll see the the new Unallocated space. This is where we will be installing the new Linux distro.\nOnce you have everything backed up and all of your active programs are shut down run the command in the Windows terminal below. This will ensure your entire system is not in hibernation and ensures the system completely shuts down.\nshutdown /s /f /t 0\nAll the prep work is done! Lets install Pop!_OS\nInstalling Pop!_OS # Now we get to the fun part. Lets boot into the live disk image we burnt on the the USB drive. See some tips below if you run into any issues booting.\nEnable Legacy Boot Sources. If you are installing on an older computer using BIOS, selecting the option under Legacy Boot Sources or Legacy USB will let you start Windows setup from a USB or CD drive.\nDisable Secure Boot. Security technologies included in UEFI such as Secure Boot can be a blocker and prevent the system from booting external storage sources. Disabling Secure Boot, temporarily—normally accessible under the security menu or tab—will often resolve this.\n1. Boot to the USB # Enter your systems screen to boot to a temporary device. When you turn on your computer there will be an option to either enter BIOS or select a start-up device. Depending on your system this may be different. Checkout this article from Lifewire if you’re having issues finding the temp boot menu.\nSelect your USB HDD or Removable devices from the boot menu and it should boot into Pop!_OS.\n2. Install Pop!_OS # Once you successfully boot to the new Pop!_OS USB you’ve created, run through the setup process selecting your language and keyboard layouts. When you arrive at the option for a clean or custom install, select custom.\nFrom the custom installation menu, you should be able to see a preview of the partitions on the system, including the space you freed up. This will be called “unused” space. Click on ‘Modify Partitions…’ near the bottom.\nA GParted window will open. Right click on the unallocated space and select ‘New’.\nNow a window will come up allowing you to format the partition to the Linux file system. Ensure the the free space remaining is set to 0 and the file system will be formatted as ext4. Click Add.\nNow click the green check and click apply. Once the operation is done you can close out GParted.\nClick on the new partition and make sure ‘Use partition’ is selected. Select it to format and ensure it is being used as the ‘Root (/)’ with the ext4 file system.\nNow click on ‘Erase and Install’. Pop!_OS will install on your system alongside Windows. Once it is done restart your computer.\nImportant! Windows uses it’s /boot partition as a part of its update process. Your boot partitions available space may eventually be filled with Linux Kernels, this will prevent Windows from updating correctly. To fix this occasionally run the following commands after rebooting Linux, this will clean out older Kernels, freeing up space.\nsudo apt autoremove sudo apt auto clean\nUpdating GRUB # You may have noticed your system booted directly into the Linux partition without the Windows 10 option.

It allows you to install Arch by selecting various options and packages instead of running commands.\nhttps://youtu.be/u2l54FMgWq4\nInstalling Arch Linux is an effort especially if you’re new to the whole process. If you don’t feel like jumping back and forth between the Arch wiki and spending hours just to not have a system that boots this guide is for you. I would still recommend running through the official ArchWiki and learning the proper installation process. Doing this will help you understand what archfi is doing in the background.\nWhat is archfi? archfi is a simple installation script written in bash by the developer MatMoul 2. This will allow you to install Arch by selecting various options and packages instead of needing to run commands. The only commands you will need to run will be to download and launch this install script.\nNOTICE: We will format our SSD/HDD and USB drive to do this. Following this guide may result in data loss if you do not properly back up or create snapshots. If you’re running Linux I recommend taking a look at this Timeshift tutorial.\nBooting into Arch Linux and Launch archfi # Time needed: 20 minutes.\nFirst we need to get the standard Arch Linux disk image, flash it onto to a USB drive, and boot in. Follow the steps below to get into the Arch installation medium.\nDownload Arch: Go to the Arch Linux download page and download the latest .iso file.\nFlash Image to USB: The Arch image you just downloaded is about 700 MB, so you’ll need a USB with at least 1 GB of space. Also, note anything on the USB will be erased when you flash Arch over. Next, let\u0026rsquo;s get the software. I recommend Rufus if you’re on Windows, Popsicle if you’re running Linux, or you can use Etcher. The applications themselves are fairly easy to follow, so go through the motions in the software and flash the image.\nBooting to the Arch Installation: Now that the USB is ready, we can go ahead and boot it in. Please refer to the notice above before moving forward. Plug the device into your computer and power it on your computer. You’ll need to (quickly) press a key to get into your boot menu during the POST screen. Common keys are DEL, F2, F10-12, and escape. It should flash the button you need to press during the post screen. If you’re having issues, look up your motherboard model to find the hotkeys. In your boot menu, select the bootable USB drive.\nDownload and Launch the Installer Now that you are booted into your Arch installation, we will run the commands to download and launch the script.curl -L matmoul.github.io/archfi \u0026gt; archfish archfi\nUsing archfi to install Arch Linux # When the installation script is launched, we will see the main menu with all all the major installation steps. Now, we will run through them all. Moving around these menus is fairly simple: arrow keys to move between options, enter to select, and space to toggle options. First, select the language option and make the right choice for you.\nOnce you hit enter while your preferred language is selected, the script will take you to the main menu with the next step highlighted. Hit enter and select your keyboard layout. Once you hit enter, the system will display “loadkey… Press any key to continue.” You’ll see this screen a few more times; when you do, just continue past these screens.\nNext, we\u0026rsquo;re going to partition the disk. Select “Disk Partitions.” For this guide, we\u0026rsquo;re going to select “Auto Partitions (gpt,efi).” For the rest of these steps, follow along with the video. There are timestamps, making navigation through the process easy.

Here, you want to use the free space from before, create a Linux Swap partition (don’t forget to change the type to Linux Swap), and use the remaining space as a Linux Filesystem. After that, write the changes.\nWhen going to the part where you have to format the recently created partitions, you MUST cancel formatting when prompted about the Boot partition; the others stay the same;\nNow go normally following his video and when he talks about os-prober make sure to check that otherwise it won’t work;\nAt the config part of archdi, where he skips systemd and boot, go to boot configuration and select the second option (grub-mkconfig);\nThat’s it, from the archfi script you can enable dual booting, 100% working!\nThanks to Evandro Rodrigues for this (dual booting) contribution!\n","date":"September 26, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/installing-arch-linux-the-easy-way-archfi-guide/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Installing Arch Linux the EASY WAY! – archfi Guide","type":"2022"},{"content":"This is a problem because one company, Google, controls every web standard used in our browsers. So, Firefox is our last hope for a non-Chromium-based browser.\nIf you look at the current desktop browser market share, Chrome accounts for almost 70%. That is 70% of the web is controlled by just one company, a company that makes money by selling your user data and pushing ads. They also have a huge incentive to get as much control of web standards as possible to increase their profits.\nhttps://youtu.be/7PjpEW9PN84\nGoogle’s dominance over browser market share gets even more scary when you include other Chromium-based browsers such as Edge and Opera. When this is done, Chromium-based browsers make up more than 80% of the market share. It gets even worse when you include mobile web browsers. The non-Chromium-based Safari does take up 25% of the mobile market share when you include iPhones. But, if we take out iPhones and include only Android-based devices, Firefox (and its forks) is the only mobile browser that doesn’t use Chromium’s engine, and it only has a 0.5% market share.\nThis is a problem because one company, Google, controls every web standard used in our browsers. So, Firefox is our last hope for a non-Chromium-based browser if you aren’t running an Apple product. Keeping that in mind, Firefox has been in a lot of hot water, which is causing it to lose ground fast.\nOne huge issue is that Firefox brands itself as being privacy-friendly and not collecting data user data. The problem is that Firefox collects some data out of the box. For example, Firefox pings Google for safe browsing to ensure the website you’re trying to visit is safe. It also pings Google to find your geolocation, which is especially stupid because Mozilla has its own geolocation service that isn’t used in Firefox. On top of that, Firefox currently has a feature called Firefox Suggest, which can suggest websites while you’re typing in the URL bar. This sends every keystroke you type to Mozilla.\nAnother more recent issue is that most people did not receive Firefox’s recent redesign well. In fact, people hated it so much they made memes about it. This redesign is the logo redesign that sparked the oversimplified logo meme that was popular in February 2021. However, looking at Firefox market share during June of 2021 when the redesign was added, Firefox’s market share only went down by .2% and then actually went back up another .5% the month after the redesign. So, this doesn’t seem to affect Firefox much, and the issue was overblown.\nhttps://youtu.be/LoYP2mEJDJs\nHowever, an issue that isn’t overblown and should be discussed more is Mozilla’s main funding source. Their biggest source of funding is also from their biggest competitor. Despite layoffs in 2020, the company has been growing its revenue. The issue is that 86% of Mozilla’s revenue comes from Google being the default search engine on Firefox, which isn’t good considering that Google is against everything Mozilla stands for. Another way Firefox makes money is through Pocket, however Pocket for users is annoying because it fills up your new tab pages with recommended articles you probably don’t care about and sponsored posts. This is easy to disable, but it makes Firefox feel more like Microsoft Edge out of the box than an open-source browser.\nBack to the Google partnership, the Google partnership is bad because it’s a conflict of their principles. Those principles make me dream of a day when Mozilla will regain its market share of the late 2000’s. These principles are listed in the Mozilla Manifesto, and they mostly go through how the Internet is now an integral part of life, how the internet needs to remain open and accessible to anyone, and how things like security and privacy are a right and shouldn’t be treated as optional.\nDespite all the issues we have just gone through, Firefox is a great browser with many features. For example, Firefox has many privacy features that are just disabled by default. It currently has Total Cookie Protection, which isolates cookies into specific websites to prevent cross-site tracking. On top of that, while it collects a tiny amount of data and doesn’t sell your data at all, the data it collects is purely used to improve Firefox (except for the pings it makes to Google). It also has a lot of modern features that make it better than every other browser, including account syncing, picture and picture modes, Pocket for saving articles if you don’t mind the ads on the homepage, several customization features, and even a built-in screenshot utility that can capture entire web pages which I use very frequently for my videos.\nAnother awesome feature that almost no one talks about is the multi-account containers that Firefox has. This is an extension you can download from Mozilla that allows you to isolate websites. It would be great if there were a certain website for which you have multiple accounts. You can also use these containers to isolate certain tasks. For example, one thing that some shopping sites do is change prices based on your information to maximize their profits. Well, you can use one of these isolated browsing containers to prevent that type of tracking from happening. Firefox even has another separate extension to specifically containerize Facebook so you can prevent Facebook from collecting any data connected to you outside the Facebook container.\nHowever, the main benefit of Firefox right now is that you aren’t contributing to Google’s monopoly on the internet. With the amount of market share Firefox has right now, it’s not guaranteed that web developers will target their websites to work on Firefox. This is why web apps like Microsoft Teams have several performance issues and bugs that are exclusive to Firefox. This makes it our job as open-source enthusiasts not to be critical of every single way Mozilla tries to make money. A silly example of this was the drama about them accepting cryptocurrencies. This is a way for them to make money regardless of what you think of crypto.\nhttps://youtu.be/eA8O97U1Pbc\nFor more information about this, I recommend checking out Nick’s video about why Firefox is essential to the future of the open web. The TLDR of that video is that Google has too much control over the Internet, Safari has been stagnant on web standards, making it the new Internet Explorer, and Firefox is now our last hope.\n","date":"September 25, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/the-death-of-mozilla-is-the-death-of-the-open-web/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"The Death of Mozilla is the Death of the Open Web","type":"2022"},{"content":"","date":"September 16, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/fedora/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Fedora","type":"tags"},{"content":"So, you run Windows, which does everything you need. But you’re done with relying on something so limited and corporate. But you aren’t ready to switch to Linux fully yet. There may be some application or game that you want to keep running. But now it is time to move your primary workflow to Linux. So, let’s dual-boot the worst with the best (in my opinion).\nPlease backup all important data before continuing! # We highly recommend doing this on two different drives instead of just one; however, this guide still covers it on one drive. If you are using one drive, note that Windows may not play well on Linux and has been known to wipe Linux partitions during updates. Also, before you do anything, we highly recommend backing up your data. Below is a video guide that will go through everything step-by-step with additional detail.\nhttps://youtu.be/VaIgbTOvAd0\nConfiguring Windows # Before starting this whole process, we will first want to turn off fast startup in Windows to prevent it from loading in the Windows Kernel from your hard drive. This will increase boot save (it’s like a mix between a regular shutdown and Hibernation). However, this can cause instability on a dual boot.\nTo turn it off, head over to Control Panel -\u0026gt; Hardware and Sound -\u0026gt; Power Options and then System Settings, and disable Fast Startup.\nPartitioning Windows # With that, the next thing on the docket is to give Fedora a place to install. If you are dual-booting with more than one drive, skip this section. Otherwise, to do this, first, open the Disk Management app in Windows, and you should see a screen that looks something like this:\nNext, we will figure out which drive we want to resize. It is most likely going to be Disk 0, but make sure to double-check if you have multiple drives. Next, we are going to right-click the C drive (or whatever drive Windows is on) and shrink the partition to make room for a Linux partition. To do that, right-click your C: partition and go to shrink volume.\nNow enter the amount of space you want to give Linux (in MB) into the “Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB”. Make sure not to shrink it to have less than what Windows currently uses, and make sure that Windows has at least some free space left (maybe 30-40 GB or so) to give Windows some leeway after the dual boot. Do note that 1000 MB is equal to 1 GB.\nNow, to apply the changes, click on Shrink. But VERY IMPORTANT: BEFORE DOING ANYTHING TO YOUR DRIVES, DO MAKE SURE TO BACK UP.\nCreating a Fedora USB # Now, we need to burn Fedora onto a USB. Make sure that your USB has at least 4 GB of space. My recommended tool for flashing Fedora is Rufus, so make sure to download it along with a Fedora ISO. Open up Rufus, select the USB you want to put Fedora on, select the Fedora ISO for boot selection, set the partition scheme to MBR, and target the system to BIOS or UEFI. You can set the Volume label to whatever you want, set the File system to Large FAT32, and set the cluster size to 32 kilobytes.\nBefore flashing Fedora onto the USB, DO NOTE THAT THIS WILL WIPE EVERYTHING ON THE USB. However, now click start (and select ISO mode if it asks). Once it flashes, we’re good to go.\nJumping into the BIOS # The next thing we need to do is enter the bios settings. Doing this is a different process depending on who the OEM of your machine/motherboard is. Still, generally you will want to spam a certain key while booting (Usually a function key or something like DELETE or INSERT). Every bios is different, so different options may be in different spots, but the things we need to change should be somewhat similar. The first thing we need to do is disable Secure Boot. For me, this is in the security tab, and you can disable it by heading over to it and pressing enter.\nDo note that Secure Boot is a security feature, and disabling it may leave your system vulnerable. It is possible to install Fedora with Secure Boot. However, this process may not work because it’s hardware-dependent and involves certificates. Also, Secure Boot may prevent the system from booting if you run a custom kernel or mess with Grub.\nNow head over to your boot options and change the boot order to prioritize the UEFI partition on your USB over the rest of your drives.\nFinally, we can save and exit the bios settings.\nAfter this your system should boot off the Fedora USB and we can continue with the installation.\nInstalling # Once on the Fedora USB, boot the installer and select “Installation Destination.”\nNext, select the disk you want to install Linux on, then click Done on the top right. This will automatically detect the free space on your disk and install Fedora into it. If you want to double-check, you can set the storage configuration to “Custom,” when you click done, it will prompt partitioning, in which case you can click on “Click here to create them automatically.” Then, you can see what changes Fedora is making to your driving.\nAlso note if you are dual booting with 2 drives and you select a drive that is already filled with another OS partition, it may ask you to reclaim space. Other than that, from here, you can begin the installation and it will take 3-10 minutes roughly depending on your hardware. AGAIN, WE CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, BACKUP YOUR FILES BEFORE CONTINUING.\nNow, we have successfully installed Fedora alongside Windows on our system. However, before enjoying the system, there is an extra optional but highly recommended extra step to increase system stability. We will be doing this within Fedora, so do not boot back into Windows again just yet.\nFixing Clock Issues # When you boot into Fedora for the first time, it will prompt you to follow a first-time setup guide. Just go through all these steps real quick.\nOnce you run through the quick setup, open up a terminal and run the following command:\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock\nThis sets the real-time clock to use “local time” instead of UTC. We need to do this because, out of the box, Windows uses local time to manage the system time, and Linux uses UTC. So, not changing this will cause time to be out of sync whenever you switch between the two operating systems.\nChanging Windows to be the primary # If you would like to make Windows the primary operating system instead of Fedora, we can do this by installing Grub Customizer and modifying the Grub config to allow Grub Customizer to edit Grub. You can do this with the following commands:\nsudo sed -i \u0026#39;s/GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true/GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=false/g\u0026#39; /etc/default/grub sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg sudo dnf install -y grub-customizer The first command disables BLSCFG, the second command updates the grub configuration to apply the changes, and the third command installs Grub Customizer.\nNow open up Grub Customizer, select Windows Boot Manager, and move it up to the top. (Note: if the icon to move an entry up is missing, it is the 5th button on the toolbar from both the left and the right)\nGrub Customizer also allows you to modify the appearance of grub under “Appearance settings”, and also allows you to change how long to keep the grub screen up and set kernel parameters under “General settings” if you would like to.\nTesting Windows # Now, the last thing we are going to do is reboot and boot into Windows just to make sure that we didn’t destroy our Windows installation. If so than the dual boot has been successful and you can now enjoy your dual-boot system.\n","date":"September 16, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/how-to-dual-boot-fedora-and-windows-11/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"How to Dual Boot Fedora and Windows 11","type":"2022"},{"content":"","date":"September 4, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/computing-basics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Computing Basics","type":"tags"},{"content":"https://youtu.be/78dc2qX7GpQ\nA ZIP file is a way to compress files to make them easier to send. Let’s say you have a group of files you want to send to someone or upload to the internet. All you have to do is select the items you want to put in a zip file, than right click them, go to “Send to” and “Compressed (zipped) folder”. This will create a zip file in the same directory as the rest of the files, and you can set the name to whatever you want.\nThe Zip file will also end up slightly smaller than the original combined files. For example, the 4 files I compressed here in this example were combined 48.5 MB. However, the ZIP file is 48.4 MB. That is a very slight difference, but it makes a huge difference when we are dealing with multi-gigabyte files.\nAn alternative method to do this is to select files in a folder, go to the “Share” tab, and select “Zip.”\nIn Windows, you can open a zip file by double-clicking it. However, in this zip folder, you cannot edit or save files without making a copy in another folder. However, you can still add and delete files to a zip file, which is a way to work around the edit limitation.\nAnother thing we recommend is using 7zip. This gives you more file options, including .rar and .7z file options, and compresses and extracts files a bit faster than Windows Explorer would. It also has higher compression ratios than Windows Explorer, which means your zip files will be even smaller. You can even encrypt and password-protect zip files, so if you haven’t checked out 7zip, we highly recommend it.\n","date":"September 4, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/how-to-make-zip-files-in-windows/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"How to make ZIP Files in Windows","type":"2022"},{"content":"","date":"August 12, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mobile/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mobile","type":"tags"},{"content":"The entire Linux community was hyped about the JingPad. It was the first Linux tablet with amazing build quality, and its own flagship iPad OS-inspired distro helped, too. We could have had one of the best pieces of Linux hardware, complete with features such as Android app support. However, this never came to be, and the company behind it seems to be completely dead.\nJingling was founded in June of 2020 and quickly assembled a staff of around 80 people. Most of these people focused on their operating system, JingOS. This operating system aimed to be a consumer-friendly mobile operating system with a Linux base and Android application support. The hardware and software teams were separated, with the JingOS team being in Beijing and the rest of the hardware development team in Shenzhen (where the rest of its supply chain was located).\nTheir flagship hardware is their flagship JingPad A1. Funding for it was launched on Indiegogo, and the suspiciously low goal of $20,000 was achieved in about 15 minutes. The total crowd funding they got for their A1 device was just under $220,000. This was a drop in the bucket because they also received ten million dollars of investment from capital venture firms, including Trustbridge Partners and Sinovation Ventures. Peter Fang, a partner at Sinovation Ventures, told TechCrunch “We’ve seen the best product iteration for work and entertainment through the combination of iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard, but no tablet maker has delivered a superior user experience for the Android system so far, so they decided to back JingOS”. These investors really thought this could be a competitor to the iPad.\nThis JingPad A1 also had an optional keyboard and pencil to match to compete long-term with Apple. From a hardware perspective, the JingPad was awesome. It has an AMOLED 2k display, an 8-core ARM CPU at just under 2GHZ, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of internal storage, an 8000mAh battery, and a camera that can take some great shots. Overall, it’s sleek and powerful, and the accessories are halfway decent.\nSo, what went wrong?\nSoftware # The capabilities were good for alpha-level software when I had my initial lock on the device. It was missing a ton of features that you’d need for everyday use, and the JingOS could not deliver on many of the things they promised. To their credit, they improved some things like the virtual keyboard, adding auto-rotation functionality and settings additions such as VPN and peripheral control. But there were also some issues that I couldn’t get around. First, the copy and paste function didn’t work, and their app store barely anything on it (and it doesn’t load at all anymore).\nPrice # $699 was the starting price of the JingPad A1, and the keyboard/trackpad combo, which is basically required to use it, cost $200 more. This alienated a lot of the people that would have been interested in purchasing it as a tinkering toy. It would have been a good move to have an introductory device with lower specifications and a lower price while they worked on the operating system and perfected it. This would be like what Pine64 is doing with their PinePhone line. To be frank, the PinePhone sucks as an actual smartphone but it’s intended for tinkers and developers to work on software. Now Pine64 sells the much better and much more powerful PinePhone Pro to go alongside the original PinePhone, and that’s likely what’d you want to actual use as a smartphone. Instead, Jingling’s approach was to dive in headfirst by making both software and hardware and they just did everything far too fast.\nLack of Communication # Initially, communication was decent. They were always posting things to Twitter and their forum as well as sending out review units to practically anyone who’d ask for one. However, things did go downhill. The first time I noticed issues with communication was when I needed to restore my JingPad to factory settings. I messaged my contact about this because I couldn’t find any resources on their website. I ended up being forwarded through several different people and then added to a group chat to try to get my device formatted. This is something that should have just been up available somewhere as a guide, but instead I had to use my press contact and even they still struggled to help me out.\nThe Flashing Process # Speaking of restoring the JingPad, another major red flag was with this flashing and recovery process. First, the software they use requires Windows which is odd for a Linux centric company. The software doesn’t really give off the best vibes going through the process and half the time it just didn’t even work. They didn’t even post a tutorial on how to flash JingOS or Android on the tablet until mid-June, only a couple of weeks before they disappeared. These guides were the last bit of communication from the company on their official forums.\nOn top of that the bootloader is locked by default and locking the bootloader is not easy. You must get the device ID from fastboot, Email them your order number, shopping channel, and device ID, agree to weave your warranty, get a unlock.bin file, and run a fastboot command to unlock the bootloader. On top of that this forum post is filled with comments of people complaining they never even got their tablet.\nPart of the joy of Linux is being able to switch operating systems and software with ease. This joy was stripped away with the device’s flashing process for the OS. It should have an unlocked bootloader and we should have been able to just boot into an image and install that image onto the internal storage. It’s one thing to have difficulties unlocking a Samsung or LG device, but to have these kinds of struggles on a Linux device is just silly.\nThe Vanishing # I’ve tried to reach out to a few people on the team, one person replied a few months back confirming initial layoffs and one of the main people in charge and my primary contact left me on read. This is after he told me not to hold off on making a video on the review unit that they just sent me. Soon after this, there were some major discounts available for the device presumably to get rid of the final stock/inventory.\nThe worst thing this company did was just vanish right after. There was no official announcement; they did not care about the longevity of their devices, and they didn’t say anything to anybody. It had to be a moderator on their Discord server to say something regarding this, and they weren’t even a part of the JingLing staff. This moderator was hopeful they could make a comeback, but most of the people I was messaging were on the executive level, and they haven’t been online on Discord in a long time.\nI really do wish that this company had succeeded because the hardware is fantastic. Their main problem was diving in headfirst too early and trying to compete at a level they weren’t ready for. Even in Discord a while back, they were telling me about very ambitious plans, including a JingPhone, JingBook, and more.\nIn hindsight, they should have put more resources into the hardware instead of the software and used the community to get themselves up and moving. It’s companies in the Linux ecosystem, like Pine64, that take advantage of the community support to end up succeeding. This could have been wonderful, and I still hope that there’s a small team that can turn this operation around, but more likely I hope that I future company can learn from what JingLing did right and wrong.\n","date":"August 12, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/fall-of-jingos-linux-tablet/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"The Sudden Fall of JingOS and their Linux Tablet","type":"2022"},{"content":"A few weeks ago, I made a YouTube video on risiOS, and a lot of people were surprised that it was Fedora-based because most distros are based on either Debian, Ubuntu, or Arch. Well, there are quite a few other distributions based on Fedora, so let’s go through some of them, specifically the ones mentioned on Fedora’s list of Fedora remixes wiki page.\nhttps://youtu.be/stIndl1YuIg\nNobara # Nobara is a distribution that is designed specifically for gaming. It is made by a Red Hat Engineer who is also the Proton-GE contributor\u0026rsquo;s maintainer and a Lutris developer. Booting into it, I noticed that its flagship version has a customized version of GNOME, although there is also a vanilla one. Some of the extensions the non-Vanilla version installs include ArcMenu, Blur my Shell, and Dash to Panel. This gives it an overall setup similar to Windows 7. It also comes preinstalled with many gaming-related tools, including Steam, Lutris, Wine, ProtonUp, and GOverley.\nNobara also comes with countless patches to different things in the system to make the computer faster, including 11 patches to the kernel just listed on the website, as well as patches to glibc to fix broken apps, a version of mesa built from git to provide newer AMD/Intel drivers, some patches to GNOME such as variable refresh rate and GNOME Extension auto-updating, automatic driver installation on NVIDIA, RPMFusion \u0026amp; Flathub and many more features. So, if you are into gaming or need to push your hardware to the max, Nobara will\nbe a very good option for all of its patches. These aren’t just things you can set up on a Fedora installation because of the extra patches to things like the kernel and glibc.\nUltramarine # Image Source: DistroWatch\nNext up is Ultramarine Linux. This is super heavy in development right now, and there are a lot of planned features that haven’t been finished yet so far. According to their website, it is meant to be a spiritual successor to Korora Linux. This distribution ships 3 different desktops, including GNOME, Budgie, and Pantheon, and they have a variant called Lapis, which is built around OSTree, similar to Fedora Silverblue. It also tries to streamline the developer experience with tools like umpkg for packaging. Booting into the flagship Budgie edition, I first noticed how beautiful the distro is, thanks to the Fluent GTK and icon themes. It comes preinstalled with Budgie stuff like the Budgie Control Center, Budgie Desktop Settings, and some extra utilities to extend Budgie, such as Window Shuffler, WallStreet, and QuickChar. On top of that, Ultramarine preinstalls things like RPMFusion, Flathub, and its dedicated repo containing the Budgie desktop, among other things. Overall, it’s a great distro if you want something with things like RPMFusion preinstalled and don’t want to set up that stuff yourself, and it’s also your only option if you want a good Pantheon or Budgie experience on a Fedora-based system. Qubes OS # Qubes, is a very interesting distro. This is a distro built specifically for maximum security and privacy and is even loved by people like Edward Snowden and the founder of Ethereum. This is based on an older version of Fedora; in fact, it’s based on Fedora 32, which means out of the box, you cannot install packages on the main system due to Fedora 32’s repository being down by now unless you set up mirrors for older versions of Fedora yourself. However, you aren’t supposed to install stuff into the main system; this is a Virtual Machine based environment where everything you run is through a VM of a different operating system. When you boot up, you get a very light Xfce environment, and the only preinstalled applications on the system are terminals, Xfce settings, and Qubes tools. You also have several preinstalled Virtual machines, including a personal one, where you would likely want to install most of your software, disposable ones, and different OSes for each VM, including Fedora 36, Debian 11, and Whonix for TOR stuff. They also have disposable VMs that automatically wipe themselves when you are done with them. This is a very interesting distribution, so if you are interested, I recommend researching this yourself because this is a very complicated distribution.\nMontana Linux and FX64 # FX64 Linux (Looks the same as Fedora Cinnamon and Montana Linux Fedora Cinnamon)\nNow we have the main ones out of the way. Let’s mention a few other ones. Let’s start with Montana Linux. This distro has versions based on Fedora, Alma Linux, and older versions of CentOS. I booted into the Cinnamon version of it, and it just looks like Fedora Cinnamon. In fact, reading over the kickstart files which is what Fedora based distros use to build, the only changes I can find is that RPMFusion is preinstalled, a couple of extra media applications are installed. That’s it, there aren’t even special wallpapers, and Fedora branding is still there. So, you are probably better off just using normal Fedora, installing RPMFusion, or running another one of these distros. A similar distro is FX64, another Fedora-based distro with the Cinnamon desktop. But like Montana Linux, it still uses Fedora branding and wallpapers. FX64’s website literally just says, “FX64 Linux is a Fedora 36-based distro. Google Chrome, Java IcedTea, Skype \u0026amp; RAR are preinstalled.” Just install these yourself on Fedora… Berry Linux # Image Source: DistroWatch\nBerry Linux is a distro from Japan that is made to be run off a USB or CD. Although it is theoretically installable on an internal drive, I couldn’t get the installer to function properly. It has a very minimal LXDE desktop by default and only a few lightweight essentials preinstalled by default. This does have the potential to be great, but there are a lot of issues involving essential things that are just not working properly. For example, installing a package with dnf requires you to specify the Fedora release version, which breaks package management, and as I mentioned, its installer didn’t work for me. However, it is impressive because of its limited resource usage, and it even has its own display manager, BerryDM.\nNetwork Security Toolkit # Image Source: DistroWatch\nNetwork Security Toolkit is a distro that can be used as both a server and a graphical system. When used as a graphical system, it uses the MATE desktop environment. It comes with a boatload of preinstalled network and security tools, including tools like Wireshark and “Angry IP Scanner”. It also has a built-in web interface that you can use to manage the system, including things like running a virus scan. Several functions in the web interface are broken out of the box, but that could also be because I didn’t set this up properly; I just opened the web interface and started playing around.\nKedora # Image Source: Kedora SourceForge page\nFinally, our last distro is Kedora. A “Secure, Fast and Simple Distro, made for IT Sstudents”. It uses Plasma out of the box, but the only difference in the user interface is that it uses Windows 11 icons and the Windows 11 background by default. I noticed when installing something that, for some reason, preinstalls repos for both TeamViewer and Brave Browsers despite both not being installed by default. It also comes with Google Chrome as the default browser, as well as gdfuse for native Google Drive integration. Like most of the other distros, it also comes with RPMFusion, but this distro hasn’t been updated to a Fedora 36 base yet and is still based on Fedora 35. So, I’d pass on this one, considering it mimics Windows, preinstalls Chrome, and random repos, and this is another one where you could install Fedora with RPMFusion instead. Official Fedora Spins # Fedora Plasma (Source: Fedora Spins Website)\nSpeaking of Fedora Plasma, if you are looking for a good Fedora-based distro that isn’t just stocking Fedora, check out the official Fedora spins. These are stock Fedora, but they come with a different desktop of choice. There are separate spins for Plasma, XFCE, LXQt, MATE, Cinnamon, LXDE, Sugar, and I3. Also, if you want a more specialized Fedora-based distro, check out Fedora Labs. These provide special versions of Fedora with different sets of preinstalled applications depending on the use case. These include Astronomy, Comp Neuro, Design Suite, Games, Jam, Python Classroom, and Security Lab. Robotics Suite and Scientific. So, if you are in one of those fields, check out those Fedora Lab Spins or another Fedora Spin for a more preferred DE if you aren’t a GNOME fan. Another official spin worth mentioning is Fedora Silverblue. This is a version of Fedora-based around OSTree, which means you have an image-based read-only file system. This is similar to how operating systems like iOS and Chrome OS work. The image-based system allows people to do things like try development images and then revert back to a stable image, roll back broken updates, and remove many of the “it works on my system” type bugs that may occur on a normal Linux system. Apps are also fully installed through Flatpaks and containers, which allows the file system to be read-only. This is a really interesting distro, and this full overview doesn’t do it full justice, so we recommend doing more research about it if you are interested.\nhttps://youtu.be/NRKE9W-6DHs\n","date":"August 8, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/linux-distros-based-on-fedora/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Linux Distros Based on Fedora","type":"2022"},{"content":"One of the biggest difficulties of switching over to Linux is getting used to a completely different ecosystem for applications and trying to switch away from many proprietary applications that are Windows only. Ideally, we should try to convince new users to learn how to use open-source software instead of proprietary software, but there are some cases where that is not an option.\nhttps://youtu.be/gpsmHI7oPas\nMain Solutions # The Wine compatibility layer is the solution to getting these Windows applications onto our Linux system, which essentially converts all the Windows libraries and system calls over to open-source alternatives. Steam’s Proton is built on this, allowing many Windows games to have full Steam Deck compatibility. The main problem with Wine is that it can be a huge pain to set up and configure. Several applications aim to solve this problem, but most aren’t great. Winetricks # The oldest solution to this is Winetricks, a simple Wine system config tool built around Zenity. If you don’t know, Zenity is a tool for generating dialogs from a bash script. Because of this, the UI is a bunch of dialogs that connect to scripts or commands to configure Wine. This is a very hacky system and just does not provide a good user experience.\nPlayOnLinux # PlayOnLinux was another popular tool for running Windows games on Linux. Still, the version everybody actually uses hasn’t been maintained for a long time and has a ton of graphical bugs and glitches that make it extremely hard to use. Just try opening it on any dark theme.\nIt does have a newer version with a full redesign, and it promotes the Flatpak of it on its GitHub repo that is relatively active, but this Flatpak is 2 years out of date and riddled with bugs. This can, however, still be a good option if you compile it from source.\nQ4wine # Q4wine is another popular tool for this job. But, like the other apps, it has a very confusing user interface that I don’t want to spend time trying to figure out. The lead developer is Ukrainian, and development has been halted because of the ongoing conflict in that region. CrossOver # CrossOver is one of the best solutions; it has a clean user interface and loads of specific patches for certain apps, making many of them easy to install. In addition, they have a database like ProtonDB with all the applications they support with ratings. However, CrossOver is a paid app that currently costs $60 for a year of updates and $500 for a lifetime license. This, however, does support the development of Wine and Proton, so it’s not just a company profiting from the hard work of the Wine team.\nhttps://youtu.be/ZH5JYshhtYg\nLutris # Finally, you can find various games working on Linux, thanks to Steam and Lutris. Lutris is extremely popular and makes it very easy to run a game by leveraging and combining existing emulators, engine re-implementations and compatibility layers. It gives you a central interface to launch all your games, and the client can connect with existing services like Humble Bundle, GOG, and Steam to make your game libraries easily available.\nBottles (Our Favorite Solution) # From here, we will discuss my favorite solution for managing Wine: Bottles. This app, a GNOME app, has a good-looking and easy-to-understand UI and many options for configuring Wine. On launch, you can create your first “bottle,” which is an isolated Wine instance. This can be useful if multiple apps need different versions of a dependency.\nOnce in a bottle, you have many options, including preferences, dependencies, programs, versioning, installers, and a task manager. Details \u0026amp; Usage is where you can run executable files such as program installers and do basic program management like adding a program to your application launcher, adding it to Steam, or uninstalling it. You can also access tools within the bottle like CMD, Regedit, and other built-in Wine tools.\nThere are other tabs built into Bottles for managing your bottles, including “Preferences”, which allows you to customize certain Wine and system settings for your bottle. “Dependencies” allows you to install dependencies that may be required by a certain application. “Installers” lets you easily install some applications you may want, such as Ableton Live, Battle.net, FL Studio, GOG Galaxy, and Origin.\nThere are also some built-in tools, such as a “Task Manager” for managing processes inside a bottle, similar to Windows Task Manager, and “Versioning,” which allows you to take snapshots of your Wine bottle and restore them to earlier snapshots. These snapshots can be useful if you are trying to test out a patch or change to your bottle that may break it.\nFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s leave the Bottle and head over to app preferences. You can set up different Wine runners, such as installing different Wine forks or a specific pre-release or older version of a runner. This can be useful if you are trying to run a picky app that only works on a type of Wine runner. It also lets you install different DLL Components, such as different versions of DXVK.\nFinally, my favorite feature of this application is that you can export your bottles. I used this to help my non-technical friend run FL Studio on Linux. I just created a new bottle, installed FL Studio through it, added his license key to it for him, and set up some plugins he uses. Then, I was able to send him a .tar.gz file with all the FL Studio configurations he needed, and he was able to install it with a few clicks through Bottles. This is great considering that Bottles is available as a Flatpak, so this can work across any Linux distros without worrying about dependency issues resulting from distro repositories shipping a different version of Wine.\nSteam and Lutris are likely better options if you are a complete Wine noob and you need to get a few games running; however, for those who know what they are doing when it comes to Wine, Bottles are the best option. This completely removes the reason that tools like Winetricks even exist and makes this a great thing to try if you are trying to run a game or app that you just can’t get working.\n","date":"July 26, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/the-best-solutions-for-running-windows-apps-in-linux/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"The BEST Solutions for Running Windows Apps in Linux","type":"2022"},{"content":"","date":"July 26, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/virtualization/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Virtualization","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"July 23, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/manjaro/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Manjaro","type":"tags"},{"content":"Many people love Manjaro as a clean and easy way to get into Arch or even Linux in general. But many people claim that Manjaro has diverted too far away from Arch to consider it. So, let’s compare both Arch and Manjaro, how they are different, and why more people might need to distinguish that Manjaro isn’t Arch. https://youtu.be/VzAw8a3Jx-k\nSo first, what is Arch? # Arch Linux is an independent rolling release distribution that is known for being very customizable and bleeding edge but not for being easy to install. Your hand isn’t held at all when you install Arch. You are forced to either learn how to install your system manually from scratch, including partitioning through a terminal, installing the actual Linux kernel, and setting up your bootloader and DEs. Basically, the customization isn’t an option. It’s a requirement because you’re building it. A TUI installer is being worked on, but it’s not finished as of today and is still in the experimental stages, and Arch still doesn’t hold your hand during regular usage. Occasionally, there will be an update that requires manual intervention during the update to fix something. In fact, most of the “Latest News” posts on the Arch Linux homepage tell users they need to intervene to fix an update manually. Update Intervention Required on the Arch “Latest News” Page.\nThis makes Arch sound terrible, but it’s quite cool when you really get into Linux because you configure your system almost however you want. The only things it doesn’t let you do are that you must recompile things with different flags or things of that nature straight up. Arch is popular thanks to its amazing wiki for documentation and the Arch User Repository, which has many community-driven user-generated packages and installation scripts. What is Manjaro? # Manjaro Plasma (Image Source: Manjaro)\nManjaro is also a rolling release distribution based on top of Arch. It has many similarities to Arch, but Manjaro is closer to a more traditional distribution you would install and use, like Ubuntu or Fedora. It comes with its own set of packages, although some of the packages are slightly older because Manjaro holds back packages until they are fully tested. Manjaro does this with 3 repositories, Stable, Testing, and Unstable, each with progressively newer and less tested packages. Unstable would be the closest to Arch, but like Arch, you are alone if something happens. Manjaro should, in theory, be easier to run than Arch because it has a more stable package base and preinstalls tools such as Pamac for installing packages. You also don’t have the issue with Arch; whenever you need to do almost any task, you must know what package you need and install it. Manjaro preinstalls everything you’d need to do basic work out of the box, making it easier for Linux beginners. Keeping that in mind, however, I still wouldn’t call Manjaro a beginner distribution just because it is technically considered to be Arch-based.\nSimilarities # Given that Manjaro is Arch-based, there are still a few similarities. They both use Pacman for the default package manager, and they have relatively newer packages compared to distros, although Arch will always be more bleeding edge. They also both support things like the AUR. Bug fixes on Arch should also still work on Manjaro, and if you are reading the ArchWiki 8 times out of 10, the ArchWiki’s information should also work on Manjaro.\nHowever, Arch and Manjaro are different distros. Asking a question about Manjaro on the Arch forums will get you laughed out because Manjaro is not just an installer for Arch. Calling Manjaro an Arch installer is like calling Ubuntu just Debian with a different installer. Manjaro and Arch are completely different things. There are loads of differences between Manjaro and Arch, just like how there are loads of differences between Ubuntu and Debian.\nKey Differences # The main key difference is the packages. Since Manjaro uses its own repositories compared to Arch, this can and will lead to things breaking. For example, you must be careful when you use an AUR package on Manjaro because AUR packages are built for running on Arch, not Manjaro. So, if you are installing an AUR package and it depends on a newer package that is older on Manjaro, the package can break, or worse, your entire system could fail. Another difference between Manjaro is that it has its own package management system in addition to pacman called Pamac (and yes, the naming scheme is not helpful). Pamac includes a GUI frontend for package management and a CLI utility slightly easier to understand than pacman. For example, a system update is “pamac update’ instead of “pacman –Syu”. On top of that, Manjaro has a bunch of distribution-specific things. For example, it has a separate settings manager with several tools. This includes a tool that automatically installs hardware drivers and a Kernel tool that lets you switch between kernels with a graphical interface. There are also subtle differences in how Manjaro works compared to Arch, which can break things.\nManjaro Settings Manager (source: Manjaro GitLab)\nArch-like Alternatives # Even though Manjaro isn’t an Arch installer, there are certainly distros that are just Arch (or atleast similar enough to Arch) with an easy installer. If you’re looking for an Arch based system, I recommend installing these types of distros instead. Some of these distros would include EndeavourOS. EndeavourOS is very close to vanilla Arch and is essentially Arch with a much better installer and a convenient welcome app for configuring the system and setting it up.\nhttps://youtu.be/Bz5INOLyql4\nThere are also distros like Anarchy Linux. You can also use a script like the preinstalled CLI “archinstall” script or another like AUI and Archfi. So, these are the better options if you are looking for a distro like Arch with an Installer.\nAnarchy Linux Installer (Image Source: DistroWatch)\nOf course, Manjaro does have its places and use cases, but Manjaro seems to be commonly mismarketed as a way for beginners to get into Arch Linux. But Manjaro is not Arch (nor should it be considered a beginner distro, but that’s another topic).\n","date":"July 23, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/no-manjaro-is-not-arch/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"No, Manjaro is NOT Arch","type":"2022"},{"content":"Linux is open-source software; however, most Linux distributions usually include some non-free software. Whether it’s proprietary blobs or drivers for running certain types of hardware, or it’s a distribution that ships Google Chrome by default for some reason… While the core of a distribution is usually FOSS software, there are still proprietary elements on most Linux distributions. So, let’s see what running a fully open-source system is like and look at the distributions that the Free Software Foundation recommends.\nThe Free Software Foundation is a non-profit that fights to promote digital rights and free software. Free as in freedom, not as in free beer. They are the main sponsor of the GNU project, which makes most of the core utilities that most Linux distributions use. Many basic commands you might use like chmod, mkdir, and even bare basic commands like ls, ln, pwd, and cp are all GNU core utilities. They also publish all the GNU licenses, including the GPL, LGPL, AGPL, and the FDL, and they campaign to promote Free Software against things that “violate” user freedom like DRM, Software Patents, and “Treacherous Computing”. Unsurprisingly, they don’t endorse many Linux distributions, some for annoying reasons. Some distributions make sense not to be endorsed, like any distributions that ship non-free applications out of the box, like distributions that ship Google Chrome. Even distributions like Ubuntu make sense not to get an FSF endorsement because they have a shady history with things like the Amazon “spyware” controversy and the more recent Snap Store controversy. However, the FSF ignores these things and instead avoids recommending Ubuntu because of the patients. Any distribution with non-free apps in its main repository is not endorsed, taking out Linux Mint and even Arch. Distributions that have only free software in their main repository but have a separate repository for non-free software aren’t allowed. This removes Debian and OpenSUSE from the list. Fedora isn’t included despite their non-free repos being fully separate and community-driven because its repos allow non-free hardware firmware. Even using the stock Linux kernel isn’t because it contains binary blobs, so that takes out Tails.\nTo be Free Software Foundation endorsed, it must be a complete package (unless it’s an embedded distribution), it must be entirely free software down to the kernel and firmware level, it can’t steer users into installing non-free software, it must commit into correcting mistakes, it can’t have any name confusion (calling yourself “Linux” instead of “GNU/Linux”), among other things. Because of the strict requirements, it is extremely hard to get onto the list of FSF-certified distributions. So, let’s look at the distributions that are on the list.\nDragora GNU/Linux-libre # Screenshot from Distrowatch\nWe are starting with Dragora GNU/Linux-Libre. This distribution is “a complete and reliable distribution of the GNU/Linux operating system that is entirely free software.” Well, in my experience, it’s not reliable because I couldn’t get the live ISO to boot in either VirtualBox or GNOME Boxes. If you can get it installed, it uses Runit as the init system, qi as its package manager (custom for this distro), and it uses the Linux-Libre kernel instead of the regular Linux kernel.\nDyne:bolic # Next up is Dyne:bolic. This is made by the people who now make Devuan, which is Debian without SystemD. This is a distribution designed specifically for audio and video production, and it’s made to be run on a Live CD and to not update. Because of this, the FSF recommends not running it on the internet. The latest release is from 2011, and the ISO hosting says “1 decade ago” for the upload date. It’s also 32-bit only. Booting into it is a blast from the past. It’s based on Ubuntu 9.10, meaning it has the ancient Ubuntu theme built on top of GNOME 2. This distro also has plenty of default applications installed, in fact this one ISO has almost everything you would ever need for anything multimedia related. The main issue with this distro is that all these applications preinstalled are almost 12 years old and have limited (unrecommended) internet access, which seems like too much of a downside. If you don’t care about non-free software, you are much better off using Ubuntu Studio or Fedora Labs Jam.\nGuix # Guix is a GNU/Linux-Libre distribution developed by the GNU Project with its own custom package manager and init system. This distro has a declarative operating system configuration, making it like distributions like Fedora Silverblue and NixOS. Guix’s main appeal is that you can build an entire system from a config file. This distribution also comes with a TUI installer, like some Arch installation scripts, and allows you to choose what desktop you want (except Plasma, for some reason). The stable version has somewhat old packages. It ships with GNOME 3.34, an even older version of GNOME than Debian 11 and RHEL 9. It’s the “latest” version, which is slightly newer but still not bleeding edge. It ships GNOME 40 instead of 3.34 which is only 1 GNOME version ahead of Debian 10 and still two versions behind the current version of GNOME at the time of writing this. Guix’s main feature is its package manager, which allows things like rollbacks, installing packages without root, and many other features. This is an incredibly unique distribution, and this brief overview doesn’t do it full service, so check this one out if you are even remotely interested. Hyperbola and Parabola # Screenshot from DistroWatch\nThe next two distributions are very similar, so I’ll group them into one. Hyperbola and Parabola. Parabola is essentially Arch Linux but without non-free software. It also uses Linux-Libre instead of the stock Linux kernel and installs very similarly to Arch. It supports OpenRC alongside SystemD and still has 32-bit support despite Arch dropping it officially. But there’s not much to say about Parabola other than that, it’s just Arch, but with more Freedom. Hyperbola is another Arch-based product, but it holds back packages for stability. This makes Hyperbola essentially an LTS version of Parabola. It uses the LTS version of Linux Libre and still has GNOME 3.38-based GNOME apps. It also doesn’t package SystemD at all due to not following “their social contract,” and it removes Java and D-Bus. Unless you really care about free software, I’d recommend Arch over Parabola just because of more community support and more packages available, and Hyperbola takes it too far, putting their philosophy over functionality. PureOS # Next, we have PureOS. This is the first distro on this list that feels fully complete. It’s based on Debian Testing and features a very vanilla GNOME experience, although it has slightly older packages because it uses GNOME 3.38. Notably, this distro is funded by Purism and supports the Librem 5 Linux Smartphone, so a few mobile-specific features are included in this distro. PureOS doesn’t use Linux-Libre but removes binary blobs from the stock kernel. It also has some weird defaults, like GNOME Web being the default browser, but it is a very polished distribution and doesn’t feel like a hacked-together Debian respin. PureOS is the first FSF distro we can recommend for a day-to-day experience, but it’s more of an intermediate-beginner distro regarding the experience you need.\nTrisquel # Next up is Trisquel. This is an Ubuntu-based distro, making it slightly easier for beginners to pick up. The latest 10.0 release from February is based on Ubuntu 20.04, so it’s about 2 years behind the current Ubuntu version, but that flaw aside, it’s a solid distro. By default, it uses MATE and, impressively, only runs 750 megabytes of RAM out of the box. This distro also has editions running Plasma, LXDE, and Sugar. It has a modified version of Firefox called Abrowser, which has an add-on store with only free software, adds fingerprint resistance, disables location sharing, and removes Pocket. Overall, this is decent, but like most other distros on this list, this is solid but also not unique enough to use if you don’t care about non-free software.\nUtoto # Utoto 2017 (Screenshot from DistroWatch)\nNow for the last desktop distro, Utoto. This was the first distro to be FSF certified, and it was based on Gentoo until 2017, when they switched to an Ubuntu base. I don’t know much about this distro because the entire website is in Spanish, and the translated versions have many dead links; I also couldn’t get this installed in GNOME Boxes or VirtualBox. The latest video I could find on this distribution was from 2013, and back then, this distribution was an old macOS clone. However, for the 2017 version, the screenshot from Distrowatch is just Ubuntu with some desktop icons for manuals and Icecat instead of Firefox. Distrowatch also marks this as discontinued, so I’m not sure why this is still endorsed by the FSF.\nOther OSes # Finally, let’s quickly review some specialized distributions we cannot test. LibreCMC is a fully free embedded operating system designed for routers and single-board computers. It also uses Linux-Libre and the Opkg package manager. ProteanOS is another embedded distribution using the prokit package manager, allowing packages to be built at run time for different hardware use cases.\nFinally, the last operating system is a non-GNU Linux distribution called Replicant. This fully free version of Android replaces all non-free libraries and apps with free software. However, it is only fully maintained and supported on ancient phones such as Samsung Galaxy S2s or S3s and the Galaxy Nexus, so if you just want something Degoogled, I’d recommend Lineage or CalyxOS over this, or even something like iodeOS or /e/OS. However, if you really want a fully free phone, this does exist. Overall, FSF-certified distros vary in quality. Several of them are straight-up unmaintained, a couple of them wouldn’t even boot for me (at least in VMs), and many of them are just a base distro with non-free software removed. The only two distros I would use over another distro on which it might be based are GNU/Guix and PureOS. Every other distro is just a base distro with non-free software removed, and at that point, you are only running them to flex on people still using proprietary software. Most people are going to want to stick with another distro.\n","date":"July 16, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/free-software-foundation-distros/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"These Linux Distros are ACTUALLY FREE. Stallman Approved!","type":"2022"},{"content":"Chrome OS Flex is a way to run Chrome OS on almost any computer you would like, even if it isn’t a Chromebook. What we’ll be going through is the pros and cons, the installation process, and my personal experience with it, as I’ve been playing around with Chrome OS Flex on all the devices I have available to me. If you don’t know Chrome OS, it’s an operating system built around Chrome. The idea is that most people boot into whatever their OS is, and then the only thing they do is open a web browser. So, Google thought, why not get rid of the “bloat” that is an operating system and make Chrome the operating system? This makes the OS very dependent on web apps and things along that nature and makes Chrome OS one of the best choices for people who want to go on Facebook or write a Google Doc occasionally. However, Chrome OS is also bad for many people who depend on their computers for professional work.\nhttps://youtu.be/oTOoqjycn2Q\nPros and Cons # In terms of some of the pros, it’s very lightweight. It was designed with crappy $100 laptops in mind. These are the same laptops with Intel Celerons, 4GB of RAM, and sometimes storage as low as 16 GB. Chrome OS is also probably the OS that requires the least amount of maintenance, even compared to something like Windows or macOS. The system auto-updates by itself, but it’s not an annoying update process like Windows can be. Also, since everything is a web app, your apps don’t need to be updated either. This makes it the best OS to throw on a grandma’s computer so she can share back-in-my-day memes on Facebook all day. This would also be a good option for reviving older computers, in theory, because of the low resource usage.\nThe main issue with ChromeOS involves software compatibility. Because you are forced to use entirely web apps, you are also forced to deal with the limitations of a web app. For example, Microsoft 365 is missing many features in its web apps compared to desktop Microsoft Office, and even apps like Discord are missing features like push-to-talk on the web app. This can be somewhat mitigated in an official Chromebook thanks to the support for Android apps, but you aren’t getting that support on Chrome OS Flex yet. This also makes certain workloads on Chrome OS impossible. If you’re trying to do graphic design, gaming, or video editing on Chrome OS, it’s technically possible, but good luck. If you are a power user, you can enable Linux support and run some Linux apps, which is great. Still, compatibility with Linux apps is haphazard, so you’re better off running a Linux distro for software compatibility. Another huge issue is the data collection Google collects from Chrome OS users. Chrome is already known for being a privacy nightmare, so take Chrome’s bad privacy and turn it into your entire operating system.\nChrome OS Flex has some hardware compatibility issues. Most computers should work, but there’s also a fair share that doesn’t. Just look at Michael MJD’s video, where Chrome OS Flex doesn’t install on several laptops he has, including two MacBooks. My experience was very similar. Although this is a developer previewer, even some of my hardware has gained better support since I last used it when it was announced. https://youtu.be/rBtRR5aFxF0\nInstallation # The installation process is weird. Instead of downloading an ISO and burning that to a USB, you must download Chrome’s special “Chromebook Recovery Tool” extension, scroll through a list of devices to select “Chrome OS Flex”, and then you can create a USB. Also, this tool doesn’t work on Linux, so if you are a Linux user you must manually download a .bin file and do burn that to a USB.\nLuckily after this, the installation process is quite simple, in fact it only takes just a few clicks to get running. But this installer has is missing several options including custom disk partitioning which makes dual booting annoying because you must install Chrome OS Flex first before the other OS.\nLaptops # The first laptop I tried was an old garbage laptop with Windows 7 Starter edition. But it wouldn’t boot and stay stuck on the Chrome OS splash screen.\nAfter that, I tried my ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 Gaming laptop. However, it simply would not install on the device because it did not recognize the laptop’s SSD (not a surprise; even Windows needs drivers for this SSD). Luckily, I could boot into a live environment to test it out. After signing into a Google account, it was a wonderful experience. Chrome OS on a 2k display looks amazing, and it was super snappy, although I couldn’t get the Wi-Fi drivers to work, so I had to use Ethernet. Overall, though, all the web apps opened quickly, and just general use was very pleasant. I did try to get into a Linux environment, but, unsurprisingly, it did not allow me to do this in the live environment without fully installing Flex.\nThe next device I tried was a ThinkPad T450. This is a great machine if you are looking for a budget laptop, you can grab one of these with an I5 and a decent amount of RAM for between $200-300. I had much better luck this time running Chrome OS, and the device performs very well with basic tasks, including any web app. It did have higher RAM usage than what I’m used to, but it could be one of those things where “unused RAM is wasted RAM”. For regular web browser-type things, this should be a decent experience. The Wi-Fi does work, although it can be hit or miss by more advanced networks like my university’s Wi-Fi. The Linux environment was able to install correctly. I was able to open htop, and I was able to get GIMP working, although some menus had bugs. Installing Kdenlive through APT was a nightmare with many different flickering issues, although this machine isn’t powerful enough for Kdenlive anyway. This laptop is an example of how Chrome OS Flex shines, although I would still prefer to run a Linux distro on it.\nOther than a web browser, the two applications I use most on Linux are Kdenlive and GIMP. GIMP ran well and performed remarkably, but Kdenlive flat-out did not work at all. It did open, though, and that’s a start. So, ignoring Linux for the time being, the actual device performed well. Having multiple tabs open made the system resources shoot up, but no major performance was hit while using the system. Desktops # The last thing I tried was the AMR5 Mini-Gaming PC. Just like the gaming laptop, the Wi-Fi didn’t work, although this is less of a big deal because it’s a desktop. However, it is weird that ChromeOS has so many Wi-Fi issues because of the Linux base. Firing up the machine and basic usage works completely fine besides Wi-Fi. I tried to do a screen recording on it for the YouTube video version of this article; the audio on this recording was garbage and even cut out completely after a while.\nLinux Applications # After enabling Linux applications on the mini gaming PC, GIMP worked completely fine on Chrome OS Flex, other than the menu issue mentioned earlier. After some tinkering, I figured out Flatpaks work a lot better than APT packages and AppImages worked the best, in fact the AppImage of Kdenlive was fully usable for editing on this system. Steam would install through Flathub, however Splitgate’s FPS counter showed 1 FPS and the screen was just black. I then removed the Flatpak and installed it through APT. After this, I got slightly further into Splitgate, but it was still a terrible experience, and CS:GO wouldn’t load at all.\nOverall # If you want to do anything beyond web browsing and web apps, Chrome OS is not a great option. If you have bad hardware, install a lightweight Linux distro. Installing Chrome OS on moderately good hardware is a complete waste of time because of all the limitations. As mentioned earlier, this is an early developer preview of ChromeOS, and it’s moving fast. Even the Thinkpad I tested earlier didn’t work a couple of months ago. Hopefully, if Linux apps worked better and I could have a smooth gaming experience, this could be a good experience, especially if you are in Google’s ecosystem. However, I would still recommend a standard Linux install over this.\n","date":"July 15, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/chrome-os-flex-is-a-nightmare/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Chrome OS Flex is a NIGHTMARE!","type":"2022"},{"content":"Today we are going to be taking a look at, Fedora and Arch Linux. Specifically we will look at some of the main differences between them, as Fedora and some Arch-based Linux distribution seems to be where I always end up when trying to pick a distro.\nBoth Arch and Fedora generally are considered cutting edge distributions, so all the packages are up-to date in comparison to something like Debian; however, the way in which they achieve that is different, so on both you will be getting, the latest versions of your preferred desktop environment, the latest kernels, latest versions of your favorite applications, and more.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_XIoPZ5u_U\n00:00 – Intro 00:40 – Update Structure 02:04 – OnlyOffice [Sponsor] 02:59 – Backing 03:26 – Package Management 04:34 – Repositories 06:23 – Installation 07:28 – Thoughts\nUpdate structure # Arch is a rolling release distribution which means that you install it once and than keep on updating individual packages on the system. There is no Arch Linux version 2 that you need to install after 6 months, so you can just install Arch and just update the system as you use it. Fedora on the other hand is a fixed release distribution. Fedora currently has a new release around every 6 months. This means that every 6 months you need to upgrade to the latest release of Fedora.\nWhile Arch is somewhat more convenient to run because you don’t need to update your OS as often, it can cause issues when Arch decides to make a system breaking change which means that some updates may require manual intervention, and the system will just be less stable overall compared to Fedora. This may sound bad, but I’ve only had one occasion where I boot issues after a update, and I think it had something to do with NIVIDA drivers on Manjaro. Fedora’s frequent update cycle is what allows it to be cutting edge while still being stable enough for even a Linux novice to use comfortably. For example, a potentially system breaking change would just wait until the next major Fedora update so that way any bugs can be worked out and fixed. We even saw this in the last 36 update as its release date was push forward a few times as bugs were eliminated.\nBacking # Now let’s discuss the backing of these distros. Just like how OnlyOffice backed and sponsored this video. OnlyOffice is a fantastic all-on-one office suite that is fully compatible with Microsoft Office. Within the single application they have full featured word processing, presentation, and spreadsheet applications. In the latest release they added an integrated PDF viewer and conversion tool as well as many more major updates and changes. I’ve been using OnlyOffice on Windows, Linux, and even on the Cloud within my NextCloud instance. In addition to their free and open source desktop applications they have online document servers and workspace tools all with free community versions. So head down to the description to download OnlyOffice for any platform, and if you’re on Linux you have options for all major packaging formats.\nNow with that, Arch and Fedora are both community projects, however Fedora is funded by Red Hat and therefore shares some infrastructure and ties. This can be noticeable in some places, for example going to file a bug report takes you to Red Hat’s Bugzilla which requires it’s own account, in return Red Hat bases its self off of Fedora which essentially makes Red Hat the LTS version of Fedora. So, the brand new release of Red Hat 9 is based on Fedora 34.\nArch on the other hand is a fully independent community project with no corporate ties.\nPackage Managers # Package Management is where, in my opinion, Arch starts to pull some wins.\nFedora and Arch currently use different package managers, with Arch using Pacman and Fedora using DNF. Pacman is known for being somewhat confusing for new Arch users. For example, instead of running `pacman install firefox`, you would do `pacman –Syu firefox`, the –S installing it, -y Updating your repositories and -u Updating installed packages.\nDNF is a bit easier to use, for example to install Firefox, simply just run “dnf install firefox”. It even automatically updates your repositories for you which means you don’t have to run apt update like on Ubuntu, and it makes sure that dependencies are up to date which prevents weird dependencies issues you can get on Arch if you don’t keep your install up to date. However DNF is known to be one of the slowest package managers, which is a huge con, not only for DNF but for Fedora as a whole.\nRepositories # Speaking of packages, let’s talk about these distributions repositories. Fedora just has 2 repositories, 1 main one and 1 for updates. Arch is a bit more complicated with several different repos including Core, Extra, Community, and MultiLib, and staging and testing repos.\nAccording to pkgs.org, Fedora’s main repo alone has almost 68,000 packages, which actually beats Ubuntu by around 2000 packages, making Fedora’s repo one of the biggest of any distros. This repo however only ships open source packages and they even avoid shipping open source things that could be considered a legal risk for Fedora such as emulators and ffmpeg. So you will most likely need to install another repo like RPM Fusion to get around this limitation.\nArch’s repos are somewhat small with just under 13,000 packages in it’s non staging and testing repos. This is very small, even compared to small distros like Void Linux which has a bigger repository with just over 18000 packages in total, including the non-free repos. To get around this, Arch has the AUR, Arch User Repository, a giant repo of unofficial user generated packages. These can very in quality, but generally there is an AUR package for almost everything you can think of.\nFor me personally this is where Arch shines, for example, the AMD Pro drives that are made specifically for Ubuntu will actually give you better success installing them on Arch though the AUR with less steps and limited configuration needed.\nFedora has something similar to the AUR called COPR which allows anyone to easily make their own RPMs and maintain them, not just for Fedora but for several other distros including Red Hat Linux and even OpenSUSE. The main issue though is this is similar to the PPA system which means you may find your self having several extra repos installed through Copr.\nInstallation # Lastly, lets talk about the installation. Fedora uses the Anaconda installer which has gotten criticism for being somewhat confusing. The main install process is straight forward enough, but the the general layout is just not common compared to other installation application like Calamaris.\nArch on the other hand makes installing Fedora look like installing Chrome. Until recently it didn’t even have an installer and you would just have to go on the Arch wiki and install it step by step yourself. This changed on April fools day of 2021 with the introduction of archinstall. This is a TUI script to help you install and setup Arch. It can still be a bit confusing which is there are several other arch scripts such as Archfi available, and there are entire Linux distros dedicated to making Arch easier to install like Arch GUI or EndeavourOS, and because of this, if you are a beginner I’d generally recommend installing something easier that provides the benefits of Arch like EndeavourOS or even Manjaro.\n","date":"June 11, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/fedora-vs-arch-linux/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Fedora vs Arch Linux - Battle of the Best!","type":"2022"},{"content":"The time is here!

I’ll post the Tweet below so you can browse all the replies if you’d like to.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechHutTV/status/1515344404608806914\nI won\u0026rsquo;t be diving into the installation steps for this article for these applications. Please refer to the GitHub repositories and official documentation for these applications\ntoipe — a terminal based typing test written in Rust # This is the perfect little tool for those who enjoy typing speed tests. This is a trusty terminal typing tester written in the Rust programing language. You can run this application directly from the binary downloaded from GitHub or install it via cargo.\nttps://github.com/Samyak2/toipe\nbottom— graphical process/system monitor for the terminal # If one thing is certain, we have a ton of options for monitoring our systems through the terminal. You’re probably familiar with tools like top, htop, and btop, but this is bottom! Like all monitors, you can see your CPU, RAM, network usage, and more. In addition, there are many customization options, including pre-built color themes, changing the default behavior and layout of widgets, and filtering out entries in disk and temperature widgets.\nhttps://github.com/clementtsang/bottom\nwordgrinder — simple, Unicode-aware word processor # wordgrinder is a simple character cell word processor that runs on the console. It is primarily designed for text entry. It’s designed to get the hell out of your way and let you write; it does very little, but what it does it does well.\nIt supports Unicode, basic paragraph styles, basic character styles, basic screen markup, a menu interface that means you don’t have to remember complex key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other useful features.\nhttps://github.com/davidgiven/wordgrinder\nmicro — simple terminal text editor # If you use Nano often, you would probably most likely enjoy using the micro text editor. This is a highly customizable text editor that allows you to set color themes, it has syntax highlighting, and even a virtual terminal built right into the text editor, similar to IDEs that let you run a terminal at the bottom for testing. It also has common keybinds similar to editors like Gedit and Notepad++, so you won’t have to look up how to exit the text editor if you open it like you might with Vim. Once in it can hit CTRL-T to open a new tab, and then you can ALT+ and ALT+. To switch between tabs, hit CTRL+E to run a command, and you can run “split” or “split” to split your terminal into two files and CTRL+W to switch between them. Let’s hit CTRL-E again and run “term,” which gives us a terminal within the text editor, and then if we exit micro, we can install plugins just by running “micro install plugin-name”. Another cool feature is that you can use your mouse to do basically anything through Micro, including switching tabs and selecting text. So, if you need a decent text editor for an old craptop, this is a very good option.\nhttps://micro-editor.github.io\nMidnight Command (mc) – terminal file manager # Next up, we have Midnight Commander, or MC for short.

Type MC to open it, and it should open up two panes full of files that you can switch between with a tab. If you need to run a terminal command in a file pane, start typing and run your choice command. You can also use the function keys, including F3 to view a file, F4 to edit a file, F5 to copy a file, and more listed at the bottom. F2 opens a menu that allows you to do things like zip up a file. The mouse also works for people who aren’t too comfortable on a terminal, although things like drag and drop won’t work properly.\nmidnight-commander.org/\nespeak – text to speech generator # espeak is a command line tool for text-to-speech.

But before we get into the actual benchmarking, we must first discuss these different packaging formats and some of their key differences.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to focus on Flatpaks, Snaps, and AppImages. All of these have the benefit of being independent of your Linux distribution, meaning that you can run all of these packaging formats no matter what version or distribution of Linux we\u0026rsquo;re running. This differs from something like APT, Pacman, DNF, or whatever it may be, because those are distribution-specific package management systems.\nFlatpak # So now, to cover some of the differences. First up, I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about flatpaks. This is a decentralized system where you can pull applications from various sources. Flathub is the most popular currently; the actual Flatpak applications run in a sandboxed environment. So, it will be completely separate from your system\u0026rsquo;s runtime. These sandbox applications include everything you will need to run the application, including all of the dependencies. Generally, this also makes Flatpaks secure because it won\u0026rsquo;t interfere with your system unless you give it explicit permission to do so.\nA negative aspect of Flatpaks (and other sandboxed packages) compared to your distribution\u0026rsquo;s native package management system is that file sizes will generally be larger because of all those included dependencies.\nSnaps # Now, this is definitely the most controversial of the bunch. Snap packages are a packaging system developed by Canonical, the parent company of Ubuntu. One of the big issues that many people have with the Snap packages is that the Snap store itself is proprietary and controlled by Canonical. Recently, they’ve started replacing some of the packages on the Ubuntu system with snaps by default. Another “feature” of snaps is their auto-updating nature. Now, like flatpacks, snaps are also going to contain all of the dependencies needed to run the actual application. And generally, it will be isolated from the rest of your system.\nAppImages # These AppImages are the most interesting and unique as they are individual executable files containing everything you need to run an entire application. So there\u0026rsquo;s just one file per AppImage. This makes appimages incredibly portable and makes it very easy to manage various versions of one application on your system. For those of you who are running Windows, a really good way to compare this is that these are very similar to portable .exe files that you may open and run on Windows.\nAppimages are really easy to run. Within permissions, make sure it is executable, and then click on the file to open it, or you can launch it through the terminal. AppImageHub is a huge repository and a great resource for finding various app images and applications. Many developers who opt to provide this format for their applications usually have direct downloads on their websites.\nNow, the main issue with the app image format is that these applications are not directly installed on your system. So, this will require more manual intervention to create desktop entries that will appear in your menus. And, of course, to update them, you\u0026rsquo;ll just have to download the new version and replace it, depending on how your system is set up.\nThis video is sponsored by SurfShark. If you go to SurfShark.deals/TECHHUT, you can get 83% off your subscription and an extra three months for free!\nBrowser Benchmarks # So, I was browsing around on our r/Linux on Reddit, and I stumbled across this post showing a substantial difference in internet speeds between the actual snap packages and a direct Firefox download. That got me thinking: What else can we do to see the performance differences of the same application but in different packaging formats?\nSo, first, let’s take a closer look at Firefox. Now, I wasn’t able to do the same internet speed test that I saw on Reddit, mostly because my internet speed varies widely. However, I could run a suite of browser benchmarks, and the very first one we ran was BaseMark Web 3.0.\nBasemark Web 3.0 # This benchmark includes various system and graphics tests that use web-recommended features and gives us a comprehensive performance benchmark as a score so we can see the differences. Now, for all of these tests, I did it on both Ubuntu and Fedora using the APT and DNF installations in addition to these various packaging formats.\nWe can see some substantial differences between the packaging formats and between Fedora and Ubuntu. So, it’s kind of a distribution comparison, if you’re interested in that. This was done on Firefox version 99 across all platforms and distributions. We can see AppImages and Flatpaks are neck and neck, with AppImages performing slightly better on Fedora and Flatpaks performing slightly better on Ubuntu.\nMotionMark # From there, we went ahead and ran a MotionMark, which specifically focuses on graphic rendering. Again, these are scores, so the higher, the better. Overall, we saw very similar results.\nIn this case, Ubuntu actually had an edge in these scores, with AppImages generally performing better than flatpaks. The native package installation through APT or DNF was slightly behind the snap package performance.\nSpeedometer # Next, we went ahead and ran Speedometer, which is just a very general test for browser responsiveness. This one was a lot tighter again. We’re seeing a lot of similar results across these browser benchmarks, which, generally, I think is really good. The fact that these are consistent between various tests basically tells me that these results are fairly accurate.\nAgain, AppImages and Flatpaks are neck to neck. And with this variation of 2%, it’s basically a tie between AppImages and Flatpaks. And with general browser responsiveness, the DNF installation on Fedora did perform substantially better than the snap package. And then with Ubuntu, the snap had a very slight advantage in comparison to the APT installation.\nRendering Benchmarks # Now, going forward from Firefox, there aren’t too many benchmarking tools that we could use to actually measure this. So, I had to come up with some of my own benchmarking techniques for some of these.\nKdenlive Render # First, I ran a simple Kdenlive render. Then, I added about an eight-minute video and one effect to the entire thing. So, some extra work was needed with the rendering.\nNow, this will be flipped from what we saw with Firefox. This is in time (seconds), so the lower the score, the better. APT and DNF did substantially better than all of the cross-platform package systems. And this was by a wide margin. If you’re going to be rendering things in Kdenlive, by the looks of this anyway, you should probably install it with your system package management software. Appimage was behind by about a 30m second difference, but then Flatpaks and Snaps, lagged behind everything by 20–50 seconds.\nGIMP Lava Render # For the next step, we ran one of my favorite little benchmarks, which is the GIMP at Lava render. I opened up GIMP, created a 5000 by 5000 canvas, and rendered out the lava texture, which is a slightly intensive process. Now I will note the AppImage version of gimp isn’t kept as up to date as all the other versions as it’s behind about six months.\nEven with this, AppImage performed the best and beat out the native installation by just about eight seconds. Both Flatpaks and Snap packages fell behind the native installation by a considerable margin. So just considering this graph, I’m going to be switching my GIMP installation to simply using an AppImage.\nBlender Image Render # Now, there is actually a Blender benchmarking utility. Unfortunately, there’s not a Flatpak or any other sandboxed package. So, I had to download some project files directly from Blender and then render those out as a single image. My computer’s not very good, so rendering out the entire animation would have taken hours.\nAs we can see here, rendering out a single image took over 400 seconds no matter what I ran. For some reason, the native installation on Ubuntu and Fedora did not work with the files I downloaded. So, we only ran this benchmark with Flatpak and the Snap package. This is one of the few cases in which the Snap package performed slightly better than Flatpak.\nThis is arguable, but part of the reason for this might be that our Snap package is one of the download options directly from Blender, so it’s one of their main supported formats.\nThoughts # Running something where you’re rendering out files doing creative work, it’s probably better to use the native application from your distribution package manager. But for everything else, Flatpak, AppImage, might be better. Snaps, in general, suck.\nBut this is just speaking in general; every application can have major differences. If you are looking for specific benchmarks, these were incredibly easy to run; you could run them yourself. Just get your latest project for whatever application you want to know runs a better time for the render process or whatever it may be, and figure out what works best for you.\n","date":"April 16, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/flatpak-vs-snap-vs-appimage/","section":"2022s","summary":"","title":"Flatpak vs. Snap vs. AppImage - Linux Packaging Benchmarks!","type":"2022"},{"content":"The terminal comes loaded with tons of great tools you can use to help you manage your system and workflow.

In this video, we will use Ubuntu server 20.04 and PLEX to stream media easily throughout your home and even when you’re out on the go. Once you have everything set up, you’re not just limited to media. You can use this to run Nextcloud or any other server application.\nWith that said, let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nInstalling Ubuntu on your Machine # First, we will want to download and install a boot-able disk image of Ubuntu server edition onto a USB flash drive. If you’re running Windows, I recommend you use RUFUS, and if you’re running on a Linux machine, the Popsicle USB Flasher is my go-to tool.\nDownload Ubuntu Server Edition # Once the disk image has been flashed onto the USB, you will want to boot into that USB. Depending on your hardware, you will need to hit a key to get into your boot when the manufacturer splash screen has displayed.\nOnce booted in, you’ll want to run through the Ubuntu server setup, which is fairly straightforward.\nSelect your Language.\nSelect ‘ Continue without updating ’. We will update the system later.\nSelect your keyboard layout, if using ‘English (US)’ click ‘Done’.\nSelect your network adapter. Ensure you have a valid connection and IP address. Since this is going to be used as a server, I recommend using a direct Ethernet connection. This will make the process easier.\nLeave the proxy address blank.\nLeave Ubuntu mirror at default.\nSelect the disk you’d like to use. For this demonstration, we will use the entire disk and deselect the LVM group option. You will see a summary of the file system changes.\nSet up your name, server name, username, and password.\n**Select ‘Install OpenSSH server’.\nSkip Snap installs for now.\nFrom here, you’ll want to remove the USB drive and restart your Ubuntu server. After the first boot, you’ll want to log in with the user and password you created when setting up the machine. Once you’re in, run the commands to update your system.\nWhen booted into the server, run apt update commands\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade https://youtu.be/lXcfKTNObOo\nSetting up Ubuntu for SSH # Once your system is updated, we\u0026rsquo;re going to need to get the local IP address to SSH into the system. You could do all this on the server machine, but using SSH will make it way easier to copy commands and easily move media files to your new server. First, to find your IP, run the following command.\nip a Your IP address will be after ‘inet’ and will likely be the first address that doesn’t end in a 0 or 1. For my machine, the local IP address is 192.168.0.60, so that\u0026rsquo;s what I’ll be using for the rest of this article.\nOnce you have this done, you’ll want to make sure you have OpenSSH installed on your main computer. You can run “ssh” in the terminal to check. As a reminder, this will only work on your local network. In order to connect to a machine outside of your home network, you will want to set up port forwarding and add additional security to your systems.\nOnce you have OpenSSH installed, you can SSH into your new server.\nssh 192.168.0.yourip It will ask you for your password, and once you are in, it will look like a normal terminal instance, but it will be for the server, as it will display as username@servername. Once you are in, we can set up Plex.\nDownload and Install PLEX # Download using this command. This may be an older version, but we will update shortly.\nwget https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-media-server-new/1.19.3.2852-219a9974e/debian/plexmediaserver_1.19.3.2852-219a9974e_amd64.deb Install using the dpkg command\nsudo dpkg -i plexmediaserver_1.19.3.2852-219a9974e_amd64.deb Enable and Update the PLEX server # Enable the Plex media server on boot:\nsudo systemctl enable plexmediaserver.service Start the Plex media server:\nsudo systemctl start plexmediaserver.service Verify the status of Plex media server service:\nsudo systemctl status plexmediaserver.service Once we know it works and verify that the service is running, we can add the plexmediaserver to your repositories. Doing this will allow Ubuntu to update PLEX using the standard updating commands.\necho deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add - Update PLEX by running the system update and upgrade commands.\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade Accessing PLEX Server # You should now be able to visit http://192.168.0.60:32400/web and connect via the PLEX web interface. After you login to an account it will ask you where your media is stored. You should always plug a USB in and move files using commands, but we are going to go the easy route.\nOpen Dolphin or another file browser and connect to the server via sftp. Change my local IP address for yours. sftp://brandon@192.168.0.60\nNow you have full control over the file system on the server. When I do this, I create a media folder in my home directory, and within the media folder, I make one for movies and one for shows. The organization of this is all up to you. Move your files into a media directory on your new server.\nI recommend checking out this article from PLEX, which will show you how to name your file to help PLEX organize the meta data of your media files.\nFile Naming Tips: Installation | Plex Support\nLaptop Tip: Disable Suspend on Lid Close. # We will need to edit the Systemd login configuration file to do this.\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf When editing this, you should only need to uncomment and change the first HandleSuspendKey option, but you can edit the addition setting depending on your hardware. “Uncomment” the following keys and change their values to ignore:\nHandleSuspendKey=ignore HandleLidSwitch=ignore HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind Done! # Video Timestamps 00:00 – Introduction 01:40 – Ubuntu Server USB 03:48 – Installing Ubuntu Server 10:00 – First Boot Steps 11:49 – SSH into Server (terminal) 14:40 – Install/Enable PLEX 17:05 – SFTP into Server (files) 19:40 – Laptop Lid Tips 21:35 – Setting up PLEX 24:46 – Thank you! pls sub\nYou can now finish the setup in your web portal and access your content essentially anywhere.

Resolve is a professional-level video editor that requires a very specific environment to run properly. Below are the minimum requirements.\nMinimum system requirements for Linux\nCentOS 7.3\n16-32 GB of system memory\nDiscrete GPU with at least 2GB of VRAM\nGPU which supports OpenCL 1.2 or CUDA 11\nNVIDIA/AMD Driver version – As required by your GPU\nImportant Note: Using the free version of DaVinci Resolve in Linux will require uncompressed .mov files. These file sizes are LARGE, around 5-30 GB for a 10min video. If this is a no-go for you, I’d recommend Kdenlive.\nAs you can see, the software has some hefty requirements. This application will not run on integrated graphics and is very specific about the CentOS requirement. Luckily, there are tools and other options for installing Resolve on Fedora, Debain/Ubuntu, and Arch-based systems.\nAs of writing this, I’ve only had repeated success installing DaVinci Resolve with an AMD GPU in an Arch Linux system. So please refer to the Arch guide below if you’re running Team Red.\nFedora (NVIDIA) # If you are running Fedora AND have an NVIDIA GPU in your system, you are in the best spot for running Resolve. Fedora and CentOS both fall under the umbrella of Red Hat Linux. Fedora is developed by the community-backed Fedora project. With this comes similar code; thus, we are able to use the files directly from Blackmagic Design.\nFirst, make sure you have the proper drivers. You’ll need RPM Fusion enabled. I recommend following the wiki, but you’ll definitely need the CUDA driver. Install it using the command below.\nsudo dnf install xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda Once you have the NVIDIA drivers properly set up on your system, you’ll want to head over to Blackmagic Design and download the official installer *.zip archive. Once downloaded, open the terminal, go to the download directory, and extract the files.\ncd ~/Downloads unzip DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_17.1.1_Linux.zip Now, we need to ensure the installer .run file can be extracted.\nsudo chmod +x DaVinci_Resolve_17.1.1_Linux.run Now, we will run this command to execute the installer.\nsudo ./DaVinci_Resolve_17.1.1_Linux.run When the installer opens, running through it is fairly simple. Hit next, skim through the read me, agree to their terms of service, and click start to install. And that’s it—launch the application and have fun.\nFedora (AMD) # I had success once using this guide on Reddit. When I tried to do it a second time, my drivers had an error, and there was a white screen on the boot. Proceed with caution and make sure your system is backed up with Timeshift or another tool. I do not recommend this, but here is the resource.\nGUIDE : Installing OpenCL alongside Mesa drivers for Blender/Darktable. Fedora and RHEL (Updated 2021)\nEDIT: As of May 2024, just run sudo dnf install mesa-libOpenCL apr apr-util as stated by the Nobara team.\nDebian/Ubuntu (NVIDIA) # First, let\u0026rsquo;s update our system and grab some dependencies.\nsudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt-get install fakeroot xorriso Now, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure we have the proper NVIDIA drivers installed.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-driver nvidia-opencl-icd libcuda1 libglu1-mesa sudo apt-get install libnvidia-encode1 Next, you’ll want to Go to Blackmagic Design and download the official installer *.zip archive. Then, go to Daniel Tufvesson | MakeResolveDeb and download the latest MakeResolveDeb into the same directory.\nNow, we need to extract the archived files we downloaded. The easiest way is to open a terminal application and run the following command. Change the directory as needed.\ncd ~/Downloads unzip DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_17.1.1_Linux.zip tar zxvf makeresolvedeb_1.5.0_multi.sh.tar.gz Once extracted, you should have these two files in the directory.\nDaVinci_Resolve_Studio_17.1.1_Linux.run makeresolvedeb_1.5.0_multi.sh With the terminal open in the correct directory, we are going to use the makeresolvedeb script to convert the .run file into a proper installation file for Debian-based systems. Run the following command.\n./makeresolvedeb_1.5.0_multi.sh DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_17.1.1_Linux.run This will take a bit and be resource-intensive. When indicated by the last line saying “[DONE]” and the reported number of errors 0 you can move on to the next step.\nWe will now use dpkg to install the Debian package. Make sure you replace the file name with the proper version.\nsudo dpkg -i davinci-resolve_17.1.1-mrd1.0_amd64.deb That’s it! The package is installed, and if everything is set up correctly, it should open with no errors. Please note that occasionally, there are issues with the first welcome screen. You may need to force-close this and re-open the application.\nMost content in this section was pulled from Daniel Tufvesson | MakeResolveDeb. Please refer here for updated information, and FAQ.\nArch Linux (NVIDIA and AMD) # First, let\u0026rsquo;s get our proper GPU drivers. One of the awesome things about Arch is the AUR and the community around it. Luckily for us, the Arch community has packaged the amdgpu-pro drivers, so it’s an easy installation. You will need AUR access, so make sure you have yay or pamac.\nAMD GPU Drivers\nyay -S amdgpu-pro-libgl opencl-amd NVIDIA GPU Drivers\npacman -Syu nvidia nvidia-utils opencl-nvidia Now that we have the proper drivers, the AUR will return to help us. Just run the command below to install resolve. As a reminder, if you paid for the full version, you’ll want the -studio package. For the free version, install davinci-resolve; for the Studio version, install davinci-resolve-studio.\nyay -S davinci-resolve And that\u0026rsquo;s it! You have it installed. If you’re running an AMD card, there are a few more things to do, as this will require the progl script to run.\nTo launch DaVinci Resolve with the AMD pro drivers, you must run this in the terminal.\nprogl /opt/resolve/bin/resolve You will notice opening the .desktop application with application menus will result in… nothing happening. We need to fix this by adding the progl command to our .desktop file within usr/share/applications. Open the terminal and run the following command,\nsudo nano usr/share/applications/com.blackmagicdesign.resolve.desktop You should see something that looks like this in nano:\nVersion=1.0 Type=Application Name=DaVinci Resolve GenericName=DaVinci Resolve Comment=Revolutionary new tools for editing...\u0026gt; Path=/opt/resolve/ Exec=/opt/resolve/bin/resolve %u Terminal=false MimeType=application/x-resolveproj; Icon=/opt/resolve/graphics/DV_Resolve.png StartupNotify=true Name[en_US]=DaVinci Resolve StartupWMClass=resolve All we need to do is add progl after Exec= as if we were running it in the terminal.

For example, if you have a separate Steam or media library on a drive, some applications may need access to the data before you can manually mount the drives.\nThis was originally a section on the 5 MUST DO Tasks after Installing Manjaro article, but it needs more of a deep dive as it could apply to any distribution.\nhttps://youtu.be/LkwZZIsY9uE\nWarning: Doing this requires editing the fstab file in the /etc/ be careful while doing this. Mistakes may cause boot or other issues. We will make a backup later.\nIdentifying the Disk # There are two ways to do this: through a GUI disk manager on your system or through the terminal. I recommend using the terminal, but it’s always good to double-check on a disk manager such as Disks, KDE Partition Manager, or GParted.\nTo do this through a program, you can open the ‘Disks’ utility and identify the drive. You’ll want to find the Device, UUID, and the type of file system. For example, I will be mounting my backup drive.\nRemovable Media: Mounting removable storage such as USB’s SD cards etc in fstab will result in an un-bootable system if the removable storage isn’t present and connected at boot time.\nFinding the device information though the terminal is very easy and in most cases preferred to using software.\nFind the fdisk list command to see all drives and their partitions.\nsudo fdisk -l The blkid command allows you to display information about available block devices. This will allow you to view the filesystem type, UUID, labels, and more.\nsudo blkid Editing the fstab file # Now that you know your disk UUID, we will create the mounting directory. You can do this almost anywhere, but it is common practice to do this in the /media folder. Type the following command, replacing “Backup” with the label of your preference.\nsudo mkdir /media/Backup Now, we will back up our fstab file so that we can restore it to the original in case something goes wrong. First, we will navigate to the directory and then create a copy with a backup extension.\ncd /etc/fstab sudo cp fstab fstab.backup Finally, we will edit our fstab file. First, we need to open the file in Nano with superuser privileges.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab Now, we will input the information of the disk so it will mount on boot. It is critical to pay close attention to how it is typed. Watch the video above to ensure this is done correctly. Instead of typing a space, make sure you hit tab.

Librewolf is a must have on on any system especially if you’re concerned with privacy and security. Librewolf boats a lack of telemetry, additional private search provides, ad blocking, and enhanced security features. Librewolf is always built from the latest stable source of Firefox. One thing to note with this browser is that it will not keep you logged into online accounts. This is part of their enhanced security feature. Librewolf is best paired with a password manager giving you easy access to all of your account while keeping your data secure. See more on Bitwarden below.\nLibrewolf can be found as a snap, flatpak, in the AUR, or built from source. Checkout their website for installation instructions. https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/\n2. Joplin – Text and markdown editor. # As described on their official website, Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organized into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. I use Joplin as a markdown editor and to store information I will need later. One thing that makes Joplin awesome is how easy it is to sync with cloud services like Dropbox or even your own Nextcloud instance. Joplin is great for people who need to work with markdown, students, and much more. They also have a mobile application to access your notes on the go.\nYou can download Joplin as an .appimage on their website or use the command below in the terminal.\nwget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash 3. Bitwarden – Open source password manager. # Everyone needs a password manager. With recent security breaches and data leaks it’s more important than ever to have different passwords for your different online accounts. Keeping track of all of those passwords can prove to be difficult. Bitwarden is a great option and arguably the best option. Bitwarden is completely free and open source software, giving us the ability to audit the code they’re using in their services. If you don’t want to use their servers you can host your own Bitwarden instance on your own server. Bitwarden has a native Linux application, but the best experience is through their web browser plugin.

MailSpring – Modern email client with tracking features # MailSpring has quickly grown to be my personal favorite tool on my Linux machine. Most email clients out there look as if they were developed in 2003. Mailspring changes all that giving us a elegant and modern user interface with some features that I cannot live without. As someone who runs a business it is helpful when Mailspring lets me know when others open my emails and clicks on any links in those emails. On top of all that they have wonderful theming options and many more features. The only real negative to this application is that you are required to have an account to use the application. There are talks to make this optional and if you really don’t like this there is a forked for mailspring-libre package you can find in the AUR. Checkout the video below for a full rundown.\nYou can download MailSpring as an .appimage, but there is a .rpm and .deb option as well.

Unfortunately, many people including experienced Debian or Arch users get frustrated with the differences in package management and the YaST software. In this article we will overview some of the main things you should do to jump start your OpenSUSE experience. Watch the video below or checkout the article to quickly get up and running in OpenSUSE.\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=ajVqJ1nl9bM\n1. Updating System and Repositories # The first thing you need to do before we can move onto anything else is install system updates. Depending on the age of your install image this may be a few application or a massive system wide update. To update the system will will use the zypper package manager. First we need to refresh the repositories cache to ensure we are getting the latest information.\nsudo zypper ref Now we will run the update command with zypper to update the system.\nsudo zypper update Next we are going to add some additional repositories. By default the standard OpenSUSE repositories are very limited. What we will do now is enable Packman 6, not to be confused with the Arch pacman package manager. You can add this repository though the terminal using zypper or though YaST. Below you can pick what command to use depending on the version of OpenSUSE you have installed.\nTumbleweed:\nsudo zypper ar -cfp 90 https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ packman Leap:\nsudo zypper ar -cfp 90 \u0026#39;https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Leap_$releasever/\u0026#39; packman Packman is not the only additional repository available for OpenSUSE there are a few more you may want to consider adding. For more information on this check out the video above or visit this link.\nUse the command below to switch the vender to packman.\nsudo zypper dup --from packman --allow-vendor-change 2. System Snapshots # Timeshift is generally no go to snapshot utility for backing up and restoring Linux systems. It is a wonderful tool and I recommend checking out my tutorial on Timeshift 1. With that said OpenSUSE comes with a wonderful utility called snapper. Snapper includes a command line utility, but it is also easy to manager the YaST.\nTo access snapper just open the YaST control center and select ‘Filesystem Snapshots’ under the Miscellaneous section. A new windows will open up with a list of all your current system snapshots. From here you can create, modify, and delete your existing snapshots.\nFrom here a would recommend creating a new snapshot. Give it a description such as “post-install” “packman added”. If you would like to learn more about snapper including using it though the command line check out this tutorial. Below I included a video from OpenSUSE giving a demonstration on how to do a system restore using snapper.\nsnapper --help For extra projection and home directory backups you can run snapper and Timeshift together.\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=AeU_orsOCNI\n3. Essential Packages and Drivers # Now that we added some repositories and we have a snapshot of our system lets gather some must have packages. These packages will include media codecs, system tools, and more. Some of these packages will require the packman repository. Please go to step one if this has not been added.\nFirst we will install any drivers and media codecs you will need. We will be doing this though opensuse-community.org. This resource will give us the option for an easy one click install. First install the media codecs for the appropriate desktop environment, then if you have a Nivida card you will see the options to download those below.\nAlternatively , you can install media codecs using the opi search tool.\nsudo zypper install opi opi codecs Next, we will install some additional packages to give us a smoother experience. To install these applications just open up Software Management though YaST and search for the package name in the [brackets].\nMicrosoft Fonts [fetchmsttfonts], Build Essentials [patterns-devel-base-devel_basis], OBS Package Installer [obi] please suggest more below!\nAdditional Tip #1 : If you’re using KDE Plasma you can uninstall Discover and just use YaST Software Management. Open YaST \u0026gt; Software Management \u0026gt; Search for Discover \u0026gt; Right-click \u0026gt; Delete.\nAdditional Tip #2 : Some software you download from the internet will download as a .RPM package. You will notice that this will try to open as a archive package. You fix this right click on the application and select properties. Under File Type Option ensure that YaST is the default application so they open as an installation.\n4. YaST Control Center # The YaST Control Center is one of those things that makes OpenSUSE wonderful to work with. Many of the settings that are easy to change within this application would of needed to be done though the terminal in others. When you install OpenSUSE make sure you run though all the different options and setting in this application. Below I will highlight some of the important items you should take a look at.\nGRUB Boot Timeout\nOne setting you may want to change is the time that the boot loader options are displayed. To get to this setting open YaST \u0026gt; System \u0026gt; Bootloader and it will open a new window with a bunch of settings. To change the Timeout click on the Bootloader Options tab. By default the timeout is in 8 seconds. I generally change this to 3 seconds, but you can set it as 0 to skip GRUB completely.\n5. Enable Snaps and Flatpak # Snaps and flatpak is a great way to gather software on your system. Regardless on the version of OpenSUSE you’re using this is a great way to get updated packages directly from the publishers.

With this said, the most important party in any agreement is the viewer. If there isn’t an inherent benefit to the viewer there will be no agreement. Below I will list some important notes that possible advertisers and partners should keep note of.\nWe have strong leaning and preference to Linux and free and open-source software. Free and open source is not necessary, but a Linux version of any software advertised is strongly preferred. Data collection policies must be open and transparent. Any unusual wording or sharing of customer data with 3rd parties is likely to result in a declining of partnership. 📦 Review Units and Policy # We accept review units and products sent to the address below.

These sponsor segments are typically 15-60 second advertisements within the first 3 minutes of a video. Prices range depending on duration, location in content, and length of agreement. Typically, we charge a CPM rate of $15 for 30 days or a flat rate depending on factors listed above.\n🎥 Dedicated videos # This can consist of a complete walk-through of a product or service, highlight major software updates, or if you have hardware that needs a sponsored unboxing/demonstration.

We naturally fit in with the kind of technology his audience is interested in, and Brandon regularly comes forward with great ideas for both integrated and dedicated placements that feature our brand in exciting new ways. TechHut is one of the few channels we sponsor that feels more like an extension of our marketing efforts and messaging rather than just a simple sponsored mention for hire.” Andrew Stebbins Linode by Akamai\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/partner/","section":"The New TechHut.tv","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"As TechHut Media grows I am looking for individuals who can use their talent and experiences to help spread the love of technology.
